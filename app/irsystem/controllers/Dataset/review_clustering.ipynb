And the leftover would make a BANGIN' rice pudding...\\r\\nMade for Looney Spoons ZWT6 What a wonderful aroma while cooking. Dinner guest rat this from 3 stars(diner prefer plain rice) to 5 stars.

We love Basmati RiceMade for ZWT 6  for Queens of Quisine Well I get perfect rice also, I serve this with recipe#392938#392938 and the two go very well together. I kind of crush my cardamom a bite to let the flavour out, you could really taste the two spices. A very nice recipe. Thank you for posting. Made for ZWT#6 2010. The rice turn out perfectly and have good flavor. Thanks for share the recipe. Made for ZWT6. This be great rice and I love that it be make in my rice cooker!

I usually have a batch of Healthy Bran Muffin mix (#114718) in my fridge; I now have a batch of your streusel mix in my freezer. These 2 mix will be perfect mat for a quick, easy, tasty breakfast or snack. As usual, I use pecan instead of yucky walnuts. Thanx Kitten! What a great idea and recipe!

The meat just fell apart and shred very easily.  I then mix in more barbque sauce after shredding.  Everyone love it.  Thanks for share this.  I may use the foil method when cook beef in the crock pot a well. I have make this recipe several times.  It be a favorite around my house.  my boyfriend love it and we often have friend over when we eat it.  our favorite restraunt be sonny's bbq and this be just a good and alot cheaper.  thanks! There be only one word for this pull pork: FABULOUS!!!! It be incredibly simple to make and absolutely impossible to resist! I can't wait for those summer barbecue parties! My son love pull pork but can't have barbecue sauce.  This have become his favorite way of have his pull pork.   So simple to do.  Have use rootbeer and not enjoy a much a this recipe. Simple and easy! After I pull the pork apart I put it back in the crock pot with BBQ sauce for 1-2 hrs. Will use this recipe again!!! Two words...simple and DELICIOUS! Thanks for posting. My family love this recipe! Very tasty. The only variation i make be to cut up an onion in the bottom and set the roast directly on top of them (no foil). After 12 hour I remove the onions, shred the meat, add the bbq sauce and cook on low another 3-4 hours. My only complaint be the amount of time it take to cook.\",\n",
       " ' Very good, easy to make. Wonderful flavourful soup and great for a no meat meal. We love it and will make it again. It be the type of soup I love to have in the freezer for lunch which be where the leftover go from this batch. The only suggestion I would make would be that it could use a little more spice/herbs, which I would add next time but a be it be lovely too. Thanks for post and good luck in the contest. This soup have a bright, fresh flavor that strongly resemble V8. Its a nice, full soup with plenty to chew on. We like it, but ... . My guy felt it be lack heartiness and substance because it be meatless. My DD, who could live with or without meat, enjoy it but be the Mom in charge of nutrition I would require bean to give it some protien. I read the recipe 3 time before believe that it really have no garlic in any form. I find the flavor rather one-dimensional and want to run to my spice shelf for some herb to give it depth and complexity.\\n\\nI don\\'t see make it again. At least not without add a lot of cook chicken, some garlic, some oregano or thyme, ... enough change that it wouldn\\'t really be the same recipe anymore. I make this soup for lunch and then serve it a an appetizer for supper. It be good and we enjoy it. I use both the zucchini and the pasta. I decide on 4 star because the tomato flavor be a bite overwhelm for me, and I don\\'t really think that 1 tsp of brown sugar impact the taste of this vegetable soup in any noticeable way. This be a 5 star recipe for sure- It take very little time to make and be ready in 30 minutes. I dice the carrot & potato to a 1/4\" dice- this help shorten the cook time. I use macaroni for the pasta. I skip the zucchini. A wonderful hearty soup burst with natural flavors. Great soup, with nice flavour.  I use recipe#24576 for the chicken stock and fine egg noodle for the pasta. The only minor change I would make for next time would be to puree the tomato because the kid pick out all the chunk :roll eyes: I think this soup would freeze well without the noodle too. Good Luck! It be a cold night when I find this recipe and decide to try it! I\\'m so glad I did, It\\'s a *keeper* for sure. I make the recipe exact and didn\\'t change a thing. After all if you change thing you\\'re gonna end up with a different taste recipe. I have some egg noodle that I serve this over and have only a cup leave over, I freeze it and it make for a nice lunch a couple day later. 5 Stars to this chef... I will keep this one and make it again! Best of Luck. My BF think this soup be exceptional, but although it be a nice veggie soup I felt there be nothing about it that set it apart.  I do use a can of fire-roasted tomatoes, and that helped.  The pasta I use be orzo.  Also use veggie stock and white sugar a I do not have brown.  It be sort of like a tomato soup with extra veggies.  Best of luck! I make this for my \"contest judging\" dinner party night - everybody like this, but I didn\\'t find it significantly different from any other vegetable soup - I also sub vegetable stock for chicken stock, because it seem a shame to ruin a potentially vegetarian dish. Again, I like this - but it just wasn\\'t terribly special. I use 3 cup of chicken stock but I have to add water 2 or 3 time cause it be too thick.  And after 30 minute my veggie be not done.  It be at medium-low heat for almost 3 hours.  The taste be really good.  Thanks Mama :) Reviewed for RSC # 9. I love the fact that this be low fat, but be a little concern at the amount of sodium there too, but Iâ€™m certain that shop buy broth/stock would be mostly responsible for that, so I use my own homemade chicken stock instead. Just for personal taste I would cut  back on the tomato a  bit,as they be a little overpower ompared to the rest of the balance and maybe the potato too if I be look for low carb dish. The rest be fine and it be a fill healthy lunch several day in a row a I strive for an healthy eat pattern. Please see my rat system: a lovely 4 star for a low fat recipe that isnâ€™t short on taste, and which a a chop and simmer recipe be very easy to put together. Thanks! We really enjoy this soup! I do add the zucchini and use the vegetable broth. Very easy to make, inexpensive, and simple ingredients. The only thing different I would do next time be add a can of red beans. Thank you for a great meal and good luck! review for RSC 9.\\r\\nThis be a simple and easy recipe to put together for a quick lunch or a an addition to dinner.  Light and fresh tasting.  I use low sodium, low fat chicken broth, chop up the stew tomato and it come out great!  I like just plain veggie but family want more substance.  I do see this a a very versatile recipe, change rice for noodles, add meat, or additional veggies, even lentil to it.  Will definitely make this again.\\r\\nThank you Did I ever love this soup, it be so good. I know the zucchini be optional, but I use it anyway, because I love have zucchini in soup. I do use pasta - I use orzo, and it wnet very well with this soup. This be a great soup! I add the zucchini and use alphabet shape pasta for the little ones. My DW and I enjoy this with a loaf of french bread. I will make this again. I join Zaar to rate this recipe! Good luck to you chef. We like this soup okay but it seem to be lack in alot of flavor.  DH say he like other vegetable soup I have make alot better.  It be okay just need alot more seasoning.  Thanks for share though Yummy, yummy mama!! You be the best and so be your soup!!  Congrats!!\\r\\n\\r\\nLove Me & Alex :) Hay mama your soup be so good that I make a lot and freeze some for late it be so yummy my hubby just love it I\\'ve make soup in the past but none a good a yours. We have this for lunch today and it be a perfect soup for a light dinner or a lunch.  I use pasta in the soup which come out great!  The only thing I would prefer to see be for it to have a little more broth.  Next time I make this I will add more broth/water to cook.  Other than that, superb!! This be nion identical to my mum deli soup, I have to try this recipe, we do it with beef bone so I be so intiged by the chicken stock technique. I really enjoy this, a do the rest of the family. Thanks for posting. Miss Pixie x x x :D Just get do make and inhale this soup... I do do thing a bite different, but it couldn\\'t have be make with out your recipe a the BACKBONE.. So for that- I THANK YOU!!! :) Instead of stew tomatoes, I use diced, I also use 2 bay leaves, Johnny\\'s season salt, crush red peppers, and instead of the chicken broth I use 2 heap of chicken base plus 6 cup water to give it add broth.. (I be HORRIBLE at measure thing out, I usually just eyeball it) Before add the veggie to the pot, I saute them in oil.. I also use red potato because that be all I have on hand.. Warmed my HEART and feed my SOUL!!! This soup be amazing, and so colorful and beautiful! I love that I have all the ingredient on hand! I do make many alteration to the recipe, though. As I\\'m not the huge fan of chunk of tomatoes, I sub some tomato paste for the stew tomatoes. I also omit the sugar, and add a generous amount of basil and oregano and a couple huge clove of garlic. I happen to have some veggie pasta spiral that be absolutely perfect for this dish. I have to knock off a star because the cook time be way off-- the vegetable take a couple hour to get soft, and in that time, the broth reduce to almost nothing. I use four cup of chicken stock, but next time I\\'ll use probably twice a much. It could have be that I didn\\'t saute the vegetable long enough initially, and that be why they didn\\'t soften a fast a they should have. All in all, this soup be terrific, and I will be make it again and again! Made this yesterday almost exactly to recipe, although use two small red onion instead of white one a just prefer sweetness, and I leave it in my slow cooker in the morning so it be ready for when we get in for lunch. My son (whos two in a few days) eat two large bowlfuls! He love veg, pasta and tomato so i guess it be bind to be a big hit. But it be nice to give him something that I know be burst with goodness and have no junk in, thank you very much :o) Great soup and fast to prepare;just what I need this morning.I do add some freeze vegetable from the freezer.Love the stew tomatoes; I never think of use those,but I do have a can in the pantry.Thanks for posting.I make it for WT4.\\r\\nRita This soup be easy to make and make for a tasty and fill meal tonight.  As somebody who be always watch the fat gram it be also nice to see a soup recipe that didn\\'t start with oil.  I use all the veggie but chop them a bite big a we like chunky soup and other than that the other change I make be to use can chop tomatoes, use a brown sugar substitute and throw in a bite of garlic powder.  I also skip the pasta because the soup be hearty enough and I use those calorie to have some bread instead.  Made for the Family Picks portion of the ZWT4. This soup be very good with lot of flavour. I didn\\'t have a bay leaf or parsley so I leave them out. I add zucchini and orzo pasta. Thanks.',\n",
       " \" Well these be just gems.  They be so much good than ordinary bake potato with sour cream in my opinion!!  If you're bake 'em anyway why not smash 'em!!

A new salad for DH to have for lunch sometimes!  He's happy and so be I.  He doesn't like mayo or vinegar type dress much, so this be a wonderful discovery for us.

I can whip this up in a few moment and make simple chicken, etc taste special.  Thanks Cookin Mommy! I learn how to cook at my mom\\'s side.  I be the only 3rd grader I know who could accurately identify by smell any give herb.  Okay, I be the ONLY 3rd grader ANYBODY know to accurately do that.  Great on chicken.',\n",

A very tasty breakfast!  I do take a picture but Lorrie\\'s picture be MUCH good than mine.  My omelette fell apart a little when remove it from the pan I make it in.  I love this recipe a it be so versatile!  Next time I will make this in the traditional flip over omelette style that I like so much.  Made for the December NZ/Aussie recipe swap. This remind me more of a frittata than an omelet.  It be very easy to prepare and lend itself to many variations.  I love that it require minimal tend to while cooking.  While write the review, I realize that I have leave off the cheese.  I do think that some Canadian bacon would be delicious with this. *Reviewed for Aussie NZ Forum Recipe Swap August 2009* This be so easy to make and very filling. More like a frittata in that it contain the potato and wasn\\'t flipped. I think mine cook a little quick but perhaps due to the pan size. I have worry about the potato cooking....but it be perfect. Thanks Peter- I really enjoy the omelette. Photo also to be post my husband and I both enjoy this yummy omelette! I do saute the potato and mushroom before put on top of the omelette. Thanks Peter! Made for the Australian Recipes Swap-Nov. 2009. This be delicious. I do have to sub haloumi cheese for the cheddar and though they be nothing alike it be wonderful. I make this in my cast iron fry pan with a little canola oil. I will make this again with cheddar. Made for RECIPE SWAP #38 - March 2010 - Group 2 - Iced Vo Vo\\'s. Very easy to make and no fiddle a someone else say :)  Made a list this time but think other ingredient such a red pepper, spring onion and even ham could also be use or added.  Thanks for a such a versatile recipe. :) Wonderful omelet recipe.  I use Egg Beaters egg substitute.  I also \"baked\" the potato in the microwave, slice and fry it.  I saute the mushroom a well before top the omelet.  I foldedthe omelet over to give it more of an omelet shape.  This omelet have the perfect combination of flavors.  I can\\'t wait to make it again.  Made for May 2011 Aus/NZ Swap and Honor thy Mother - and be Gluten-Free, too! Tag Game. A very fill and satisfy breakfast, thank you Peter J, make for Aussie/Kiwi recipe wap, November 2011. Excellent omelette! I omit the potato since I be do a no-carb week. I can\\'t wait to try it with the potato! Also, I didn\\'t have mushroom so I sub in onions. I really like the method and think you could use the same method and change up the ingredient very easily. Thank you for a great breakfast! Made for the Aussie/NZ Swap and the PARTY event. A delicious and substantial way to start they day.  Made for Aussie / Kiwi Swap Feb 2012. This be a hearty and tasty omelette!  Loved the potato and the fact that it be grate instead of in cubes.  Left out the chives, otherwise make a direct and really enjoy - thank for share the recipe! This be a very good omelet, I enjoy the addition of mushroom and tomatoes. I like when potato be add to omelets, it be like a full meal then. I can not have cheese so mine be make minus cheese and it still be very nice. Frittata or Omelette by whichever name be delicious.  Quick and easy to make, fill and satisfying, great flavor and wonderful texture.  Made exactly a written, wouldn\\'t change a thing.  Thanks so much for sharing. What a great omelet. I use a leftover bake potato, half of a largish tomato and 4 small mushrooms. The light spray of cook oil didn&#039;t really do the job on my worn-out non-stick pan, which be why the pic look like I have to dig the omelet out of the pan. After that I do what any upstanding Nebraska girl would do to an omelet with cheese -- I add some ketchup. Yum, yum! Thanks for posting.',\n",

       " ' This cookie be great! Me and the whole family love than. Highly recommended! But next time if I make them again, I would use 1/4 le oats. five star cookie recipe. but be warned; these be the type of cookie you cannot stop eating; the texture and taste be great.  i do have to make a few changes; first i change it to make 21 cooky and the recipe work out fine.  (i didnt want to have lot of cooky lie around in case they turn out great; good thing i think ahead!) and i didnt have any fresh brown sugar so have to use sugar in the raw.  i opt to leave out the additional white sugar and i use organic bulk oat so i dont know if they be quick cook or not.  they be very easy to put together and the taste be super even without the white sugar.  i find them definitly sweet enough.  the texture be nice; chewy and soft but the texture of the oat be detectable which make it have some substance.  i use a chop up organic dark chocolate candy bar instead of the chip per my daughter request.  they be excellent and will make them again.  thank for sharing. Sorry, these be very crumbly.  Perhaps more flour or oat would help produce a more form cookie. By far the best oatmeal cookie I\\'ve ever eaten.  I didn\\'t find them to be crumbly at all.  \\r\\nI tend to \"tweak\" recipe\\'s to my liking, so this be what I do - use 1/2 cup butter and 1/2 cup crisco, omit the nut and use very little choc chips.  Was fantastic!  My family and neighbor all love them. My kid LOVE this recipe!  Great for little hand to help out with :) Yum Yum Yummy!!! Great cookie for give away at Christmas time.  I\\'m pack little gift box tonight!!! By the way i use regular oatmeal, and it be delicious, oatmeal keep it texture. This recipe be FABULOUS!  Almost every cookie recipe I try turn out horrible, but this one be so easy and turn out just the way it says!  Look forward to make this again soon! These be awesome! Definitely recommend them! I leave out the cinnamon! Awesome cookies...they be just what I be look for!  I double the batch and use 1/2 butter & 1/2 shorten and they turn out perfect! good cookie, thnx This be a great cookie! Thanks, Darshirl, for post this recipe! These be great!  Stayed soft the next morning and taste just great.  Thanks for this recipe. love this recipe! These cooky be excellent!! I add raisin instead of walnuts. My husband eat \\'em up.....thanks so much for posting. I\\'ll definitely make these again! :) Like another reviewer I also add raisin instead of walnuts. The cooky be easy to make and I get 40 cookies, they bake for 15 minutes. Both the chocolate chip and the raisin sort of disappeared, no taste of either in the finish cookie which be very crumbly and stay that way. <br/>We like them but I have have better, therefore three stars.<br/>Thanks for posting. I get fifty chewy, sweet oatmeal cooky and the bake time and temperature be spot on, which have be unusual in my experience. I use chocolate chip and chop walnuts, and might add raisin for variety in a future batch. Delicious and, for me, a bite nostalgic; we make cooky like this in my small-town childhood. Thanks! Made these tonight and they be fantastic.  Crispy outside, chewy inside.  Will make these regularly. I make these a &#039;healthy&#039; a possible, omit all refine sugar &amp; flour. I sub sucanat for the brown sugar (didn&#039;t bother to use/sub the white sugar), oat flour for the all purpose and 63% cocoa chocolate bar chop instead of the chips. They be great and work very well with the substitution for those want a healthy alternative. My family love these cookies! I have make this recipe several time now, and the cooky turn out great every time. I always split the batter and make half oatmeal raisen, half chocolate chip. Both be delicious! A perfect cookie recipe I will make again and again! Onlychange be sub in 1/2 cup whole wheat flour. Thank you for sharing! THIS IS BY FAR THE MOST DELICIOUS COOKIE I HAVE EVER HAD! I follow the recipe exactly and it turn out perfect... so chewy... sweet.. perfect hint of cinnamon. best recipe I have try so far A perfect cookie Very good cookie a written, also make a batch with white chocolate chips. Really tasty a well. My roommate want oatmeal chocolate chip cookies. Anything I\\'ve make from this site have be AMAZING!! Both he and his Dad love these cookies. I do add just 2 1/2 cup of oats. 13 minute be spot on for the bake time! Thanks so much for a simple tasty cookie recipe. I\\'ll definitely be make these again! Best chocolate chip cookie I have ever made! Absolutely awesome! I never use quick cook oat so I just pour milk over my steelcut oat enough to slightly moisten and let them sit 15 min before using. Also omit walnut for family preference and use all demerara brown sugar. Proportions be still right. I be also out of bake soda and use nearly 1 tbsp bake powder. This will be my go-to chocolate chip cookie forever. Thanks for the recipe!! My sister make these and say they be awesome so I decide to try them too. BEST. DECISION. EVER. These be gobble down by my kid and I within 10 min of take them out. I halve the recipe and get 20 cookies. I also sub the chocolate chip for raisin and half the plain flour with whole wheat flour. I have a fan force oven so I low the temp to 50&deg;c and bake for 14 minutes. My sister tell me they wouldn\\'t look do when you take them out but when they cool, they\\'ll harden. This be go to be a favorite recipe around here!! BEST oatmeal chocolate chip cookie recipe ever. I have make these 5 or 6 time in the last 5 months! I use mini chocolate chips. Sometimes I grind 7 grain and replace some of the flour. Other time I just use all 7 grain whole. Tonight I mix roll oat 7 grain and quick oats. I like to let the dough rest in the fridge overnight, so we\\'ll see how this batch turn out tomorrow. They always get a great reaction a best cookie ever! Crunchy, chewy and soft in the middle all at the same time! This be the cookie my family, friends, and co-worker ask for! These turn down out delicious ! Perfectly crisp on the outside and chewy in the middle . I halve the recipe and also get about 20 cooky . My only tweak would be chill the dough for about an hour , I find it prevent the cooky from spread excessively . Will definitely be make these again ????',\n",

I make the dough the night before, and use it the follow day, I take it out of the fridge and let it sit on the counter at room temperature, that make for easy rolling. You didn\\'t state where to add in the sour cream, so I just add it with the whip cream, milk and eggs, I do however, use half and half instread of milk. I use my own fill recipe with fry onions, sour cream and Cheeze Whiz...I be so happy that I decide to try your recipe they turn our absolutely wonderful. Although, it take me a half a day to make these, it be well worth the time and effort. Thanks so much for share such a win recipe Uncle Bill. I look forward to make these again (the next time I will make them with saurkraut!).. , this method produce a wonderful soft dough, I highy advise anyone to try your recipe, thanks...Kittencal:) What can I say .

This be the nice dough I have work with in those many years. The dough be best work if leave to sit for an hour or so after making. My friend and family get together at least once a year to make anywhere from 500 to 2000 perogies and then freeze them. They freeze remarkably well. I be however, only give the dough 3 star because it be quite high in fat and once you add all the fix the meal become a quadruple bypass wait to happen. next time I think I be go to try the recipe with a few substitution i.e the milk, cream and sour cream and see how it goes.',\n",

I like it more than my husband, but since I\\'m the poster, hee hee, I gladly give this five stars. This be really good but a little too spicy for me. When I make this again I think I might try leave out the red pepper flakes. Wooo be this spicy! I didn\\'t have fresh tomato on hand so I use a can of drain dice tomato and that work out just fine. Very good and we will be make it again. This be rich, deep and delish. I slice sweet onion thinly in half circles. Roasted garlic be a must! For the tomato I use Recipe #57884. \\r\\nThanks!!! I make this dish a few day ago. I follow the recipe almost exactly (maybe add a little extra garlic - I tend to). My girlfriend and I love this dish, and I\\'m make it again tonight for some friends. I use grocery-shelf ingredient (red cook wine, sausage, sun-blushed tomato from a jar, etc.), and it turn out wonderfully. Very highly recommended! I love this recipe... be very tasteful. i remove the case from the sausage though and pan fry it with onion some garlic and chili pepper flakes!! Was awesome even my 7 year old daughter love it. I be not go to rate this, since I have to make quite a few changes, but what I do be delicious.  First of all I use the grind chorizo, since it be what I had.  I do not have garlic cloves, so I use garlic powder.  I use a can of undrained dice tomato and in place of the red wine, I use beef broth.  It be very good have make these changes, even my 2 yo really like it.  I will make it again.  Maybe I will be able to make it the way it be written! This turn out sooo good! make a few change though,used 2 400g tin dice Italian tomatos, 4 chirizos and 5 clove garic(love the stuff) also use 500g of penne pasta a i make it for 5 people.will definately make this again ,thanks for a lovely recipe :) Sticking to this recipe bring out the best result. Have cook variation in the past use just a few ingrediants however the addition of red wine add another layer to this dish. The fragrant Chorizo if buy from a good deli will really be the bos on the plate. Sensational. This be 100% KICK BUTT AWESOME!! I be debate between this and another recipe, choose this one.... and SO glad I did! Unfortunately, I didn\\'t have any sun-blushed tomatoes, so I use some home oven-dried one that I reconstitute in the microwave. Added the tomato water with the tomatoes. EXCELLENT!!... (and don\\'t skip the step of roast the garlic, it add so much dimension to this dish!! Didn\\'t have sun-blushed tomato so use can dice (long way to town for us). Otherwise follow closely. I like the spice but it be a bite much for my wife. If we make again, I will probably leave out the dry chili pepper flake and let each person add their own.',\n",

I give it 5 star because they be yummy even when I goof up.  Next time I will try with the oil  :) This be a very easy recipe to follow and surprisingly tastey! Turned out great. I add a tablespoon of sugarless chocolate. I use coconut oil since it be all that I had. Added 3/4 cup dry sugarless cranberry and 1/4 cup dry cherries. It be fine with only two medium bananas. Because the fruit have such little sugar in it, I add 2 tablespoon of sugar. I don't normally make comment but these cooky turn out really well and the ingredient be not overly complicate or expensive. I make a few tweak because I be out of vegetable oil so instead I use vegan becel, and add 3 heap tablespoon of brown sugar, and double the amount of cinnamon. I forget to let the mixture sit for 15 minute prior to baking, but when I make a second batch (because they be so good) I didnt notice a difference between the cookies, so if you be in a hurry or you forget it nbd.\",\n",

If you like real, Cuban picadillo, stay away from this recipe !!! :( I grow up in South Florida with friend live with their Cuban, non-English speak relatives. The relative often cook picadillo. Wonderful stuff!! My mother learn to cook picadillo from some of her close Cuban friends. Mama's version of Picadillo be awesome...but not diabetic-friendly; her recipe use brown sugar and potatoes. I also eat in Cuban restaurants. None of those picadillo's have the overpower taste of vinegar and cumin that this recipe has. Recommend replace the cumin with oregano...that's more traditional. Recommend replace the vinegar with either water or broth...you want to taste picadillo, not pickle juice. :( If you want to keep the seasonings, you might try add some brown sugar. My mother's recipe use brown sugar. BTW, the sofrito be very tasty, but overpower by the vinegar and cumin. :( I actually think this be awesome!!! I LOVED the combo of flavor and, at first glance, it look more complicate than it is. This one be definitely go to be in the regular rotation - thanks!!\",\n",

I replace the prosciutto with streaky bacon but otherwise keep with the recipe. Only thing keep me from award 5 star be that I find the parmesan a little too much - but that be a personal thing.

We love this eggplant recipe.  It be delicious and moist.  Not soupy moist but moist enough to have a nice texture.  I be tear between use chili powder or chile powder (pure).

I use fresh tomato and so add some water, and after five minute it be quite well done.  But it's fine with me!  I don't know why that is, but fifteen would've obliterate it.  I think this mix would be good with pasta, or add to tomato sauce.  I'm definitely go to be buy more eggplant. This be really tasty and my husband who be a bite picky about aubergine (eggplant) really like it too.  We didn't peel the aubergine either and we do serve it with pasta too which go really well.  It be about 15 minute until it be nicely cook - lovely thanks! Tebo, this be a winner! I use 4 small Japanese eggplant and add some slice button mushrooms. Otherwise follow recipe and we love it.I will serve the leave over (only 2 of us) tomorrow over some steam rice.Yummy stuff. Thanks for a real keeper. Had this the other night...the kid really like it (ages 4.5 and 3 years). Served with white rice, another of the kids' favorites. Even my husband, who do NOT care for eggplant at all, eat it without complaints...he DID supplement the flavor with add sour cream and salsa! We really enjoy this simple dish a a meal.  I serve it with rice and it feed my family of three with no trouble.  In fact, I have leftover the next day for lunch and they be still yummy!  Super quick and easy too! Really tasty! I use it a a main dish with some garlic bread. I imagine it would be great over rice or pasta. As other reviewer suggest I add a little salt, sugar, and oregano and about 1/4 C salsa. Super quick and easy. I have now make this numerous time and I just want to add that I have change the can of tomato's to an equal amount salsa and I use 1/2 a tsp of chili powder. This be really good stuff! I'm make it right now to go along with broil sole. *Another update*: it's now 2 yr late and I'm still love this recipe. I have just add a photo of it for tonight dinner. Yummmm! I wasn't sure what to expect from this recipe since traditionally I'd only use eggplant for italian recipes. But I be pleasantly suprised!  I do add some fresh chop cilantro and serve it on top of some whole wheat couscous. Served a a great side to Cilantro Chicken (#181195) to round out a healthy and tasty mexican meal! Will definately make this one again. THANKS!! This be great.  We add black bean at the end and heat them through.  We put the mixture in a tortilla  and add cheese, sour cream and salsa for a wonderful taste burrito.\\r\\n\\r\\nWill definitely make this again.\",\n",
       " \" This be great. I think next time I will make it in a small pan a it be a bite spread out. I didn't use water chestnut because I be not fond of them. I think this would also be a great make ahead dish. 4 Stars, until the direction be correct to say what to do with the water chestnuts.  Used Margie99's idea, a 9x11 glass casserole be the perfect size.  I double the mushrooms, and they be welcome.  Used dice water chestnut from my pantry, which add another shape to the texture.  Velveeta supply it guarantee melt and mild cheesy comfort to the sauce.  This recipe could be halve if Recipe #126969 #126969 be use for the cream of mushroom soup. This meet my calorie justification criteria; these calorie be worth it!  We plan to reheat the leftover atop leftover skinless rotisserie chicken breasts, and serve with rice.  We eat this solo, but that didn't stop u from lick every last drop.  Thanks for posting. Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders. Yum!  I find this recipe in The Lady & Sons Savannah Country Cookbook.  It's a keeper--fast and delicious.  As far a what to do with the water chestnuts, you combine them with the broccoli, saute mixture of celery/mushroom/onion, and water chestnuts.  Thank you for posting! Nice and cheesy! Cant&#039;t get Velveeta here, but I use Dolcelatte, a creamy blue cheese, for a different tone. Goes well with all other flavor in the dish.\",\n",

       " ' Overall this be a very good recipe! I use white chocolate chip and pecan in place of the regular chocolate chip and coconut. My only complaint be that the bar be just a little bite too sweet for my taste - I think they be push over the edge by the chocolate chips. Next time I will use 1/2 cup of nut and no chocolate chip at all and I think I will enjoy that much more! I really love the texture though - soft and chewy be very true!! Thanks for share this recipe - I think it will become a staple at my house!',\n",
       " \" This be a great taste recipe great for a summertime bbq or a family dinner. GIve it a try the taste won't disapoint you! Good stuff.  I usually use raisin and I don't use sunflower seeds. This be a very tasty recipe.  I love the combination of flavors, especially the cranberry and bacon.  Salty/Sweet be always a wonderful treat for me.  I make this with the sunflower seeds, but I toast them first.  The dress be similar to the one I use on my cole slaw, and it be wonderful here in this salad.  Every ingredient in this salad be a must.  Definately a dish to repeat!  Thanks so much for share this wonderful recipe. I've have this recipe at picnic and want to make it myself, we have it with barbecue pork, freshly make apple sauce and gooseberry pie for dessert. This salad be a wonderful accompaniment to picnic menu (indoor or outdoor)  I also add to the broccoli by add one package of the shred broccoli slaw (for color and more shape and textures) very tasty dish, and easy to make! Such a yummy dish!!  I just add green onion instead of red, L.O.V.E. it!!!!!\",\n",
       " ' This be a great dish!  I didn\\'t have 5 tilapia fillet so I use 2 tilapia fillet and a mahi-mahi.  It be so good!  Crispy on the outside, flaky on the inside with the Italian spice and a hint of lemon.  I will definitely be make this one again! This be awesome. Even my girl who hate fish eat it. As my kid say \"its a keeper\" This be a gr8 dish... my 3 yr old daughter be a picky eater and this fish be a hit with her too.. she say it taste just like nuggets... it\\'s definitely a keeper VERY easy to cook and delicious',\n",
       " ' These be fantastic! First time I\\'ve try pecorino cheese and really glad I buy some because it suit this recipe really well and my taste in general so it be a good new discovery in the cheese world. The herb work together really well with the egg and cheese and it be quick to put together and thoroughly enjoyed. This be a lovely omelette. I love omelette and I love asparagus so how could I go wrong. Well, I didn\\'t have fresh herb so make do with dry which work out fine. There be no way that I be go to be able to flip this omelette so I just cook it a I usually would. It seem I leave it on a little long a it get quite brown on the bottom but it taste great and be still soft. I use fresh grate parmesan and love it. I haven\\'t find pecorino but will keep my eye open. Thanks for share your recipe. Made for ZWT5 Hell\\'s Kitchen Angels. Delightful, easy, still have good egg-y taste.  We asparagus and omelette lover relish these.  I even make a special trip to a grocer this a.m. to get fresh fresh sage and fresh thyme, and I be so glad I did.  I be confuse at first by \"1 bunch\" of sage, but decide you mean one twig\\'s worth, not my entire purchase.  I use an 8-inch nonstick pan and a 1/4 cup measure to fill the pan; I think it\\'s easy to flip a small crepe-style omelette.  Hollandaise be nice, but hard to justify on Weight Watchers :lol: .  Thank you for share this recipe, I\\'ll use this again and again, and sometime I\\'ll try it with dry herb to see if that be acceptable after experience the real deal (\"we\\'re worth it\").  Made a \"Slice of Lime Babe\" of the Bodacious Brickhouse Babes for ZWT5\\'s French Omelette Challenge. This be a very nice omelette.  I make it for breakfast for all the family I have in for DS\\'s graduation.  After watch French Tart\\'s tutorial, I substitute water for the milk.  I use walnut oil instead of olive oil because I think the nutty taste would complement the asparagus.  I use fromage blanc, freshly crack black pepper, and finish it off with fleur de sel. Made for ZWT Saucy Senoritas. We greatly enjoy these flavoursome omelette wrap (I halve the recipe for just two of us) with Recipe #124648 and Recipe #215647.  My only change be to use 2 clove of mince garlic to the half quantity made, low-fat milk and to add some rosemary to the sage and thyme.  Just love garlic and herbs!  YUMMY!  I make these for Ali Baba\\'s Babes for ZWT 5.  Thanks for a wonderfully delicious recipe, **Jubes**.  Made for Ali Baba\\'s Babes for ZWT 5. Well, I love asparagus, and this be a delightful, new way to prepare it.  I halve the recipe and use chive and dill instead of the sage and thyme (my preference).  The result be wonderful, and I will be enjoy this again.  Made for the ZWT5 Omelette Challenge by a Groovy GastroGnome.  (Oh...I also do use hollandaise, which be a nice touch.) This be yummy!  I make this for myself for breakfast today and be please that I choose this recipe.  The boy have already eat and be disappoint when they start smell mommy\\'s breakfast cooking.  =)  I use 1% milk and dill instead of sage but other than that follow the directions.  A treat for me this was!  Thanks!  Made for the Genies of Gourmet, Zwt 5 Omelette Challenge! wow, love these omelette wraps, heavenly and full of flavour!  I have to use dry herbs, and will look forward to  use fresh next time. I use sharp cheddar for the cheese and 2% milk.  Had a little trouble turn the crepe to cook the other side, so I pop them under the broiler for a minute to finish them up.  Bet they would make great appetizers, I sure enjoy them for my supper tonight.  Thanks for posting!! This be a fantastic recipe.  Very easy and quick to make.  It be full of various flavor in each bite.  I use thyme and rosemary a the rosemary complement the Asparagus so well.  Thanks. Sounds very good.  I would make with greek avgolemono sauce- a low fat alternative to hollandaise,  I have use this sauce a a substitute for hollandaise many times, can add more or le lemon to taste and then just use leftover asparagus water or water and extra salt to taste to  thin the sauce a needed.  The flavour of butter sauce without a much butter! This be surprisingly good! I add avocado and tomato in the wrap and we love them for breakfast. Used cheddar cheese. Like this!  Half a recipe be a great way to use a small spring harvest of asparagus. I  think next time I will use more cheese and le milk, at my husband\\'s request. We enjoy it a part of a fulfil breakfast before the kid get up. I decide to try this for breakfast this morning,I didn\\'t have the fresh herbs, so I use dry - I also use egg beater to save calorie - it be amazing!  a real keeper and nice breakfast/brunch to serve company.  It would be great with a side of fresh fruit or salad fantastic recipe! super easy and just delicious. i steam the asparagus while i make the crepes. i use soy milk (and dry herbs, if necessary) and they turn out just wonderful. we have this for dinner with a nice big salad, and it make a lovely, light, but satisfy dinner. thank for sharing! This be a delightful recipe!  Made just a direct except use dry herb instead of fresh.  The egg wrap be so flavorful, great with the asparagus but I think also they would be great with many other veggie (broccoli, mushrooms, roast tomatoes.....).  Thanks for share a great recipe! Just love all the flavour from the herb and the cheese and then that crispy asparagus so lovely and fresh.  I do microwave my asparagus though so it make for a quick and easy breakfast.  Thank you **Jubes**, make for Make My Recipe - Edition 15. Simple and elegant! Thank you',\n",

       " ' Looks yummy This be the easy sauce I ever make and the taste be uniquely delicious.  I add NOTHING except salt and pepper at the end.  I have it a be over ziti for myself and use it for Recipe #270895 for the rest of the family.  Everyone love it; the only complaint be that it didn\\'t make enough!  The sauce do cook down a lot, so I will double it next time. Thanks for post this! (P.S.  I use Tuttorosso can whole plum tomatoes.) The easy tomato sauce, only 4 ingredient and taste so good. I do double the recipe a a reviewer state and use petite dice tomatoes. Turned this down to a very low simmer and didnt have to mash any of the tomatoes. I dont care much for the thick tomato sauce so this be a treat for me. Thank you MarraMamba! This be very good tomato sauce. I use 1 28 oz can of chop tomato with their juices. I would never have consider have just tomato sauce on my pasta until this recipe. It have sucha smooth and rich taste. Made for Please Make my Recipe. 10 Excellent star !!! Why? because there be NO additional sugar add to this tomato sauce ... because it be so easy to prepare that I blush when the compliment come roll in... because the most important thing, the Taste, come though wonderfully. Please see my rat system, 5 excellent star for a recipe that will let me use tomato sauce in a LOT of other recipe WITHOUT secretly load up on add sugar and sabotage my effort to shed some kilo and lead a healthy lifestyle. Brilliant ! Thank you ! This be wonderful, no need to buy can tomatoe sauce anymore.  I use a 28 oz can of crush tomato and the rest a stated.  The onion become so soft that be be  hard to seperate and not take alot of the sauce, so end up leave most of them, but I love cook onions.  My sauce be pretty thick, probably because I use the crush tomatoes, but still awesome in taste, and will definitely do the often for tomatoe sauce.  Thanks Marra for a great recipe!!!! I love the simplicity of make this recipe and I be surprise at the special flavor it had.  I follow the direction exactly but leave a few onion in and top it with parmesan.  Thank you for share your delicious recipe MarraMamba! I have Marcella Hazan\\'s cookbook and somehow lose it. I absolutely love this sauce. So very simple. I use Contadina crush tomatoes.\\r\\nHad it yesterday over Gemelli pasta with a nice salad. Everyone enjoy it.\\r\\nThank you for posting. Brilliant!  I make it and freeze it for future use.  It freeze very well with no loss of quality.  Had it yesterday over some lasagna.   A great recipe.  Marra Mamba, thank for posting.     Janet This be fantastic! It be so simple and perfect, we\\'re really grateful for  the recipe. This go in our 5 star - make again file. Thank you! This sauce be fabulous.  I\\'ve never really use butter in my Italian food, but this turn out really well in the sauce.  If it weren\\'t for be le healthy than olive oil I would switch this out for my standard olive oil recipe.  I like it a is, but I add garlic and dry basil in the end because it\\'s just not pasta sauce for me without those flavors. Thanks for the yummy recipe though! SO glad to have find this wonderfully simple recipe for such a superbly flavoursome tomato sauce.  I never use the chemical-laden commercial sauces, and this so-easy-to-make recipe be so much tasty than just use a can of tomatoes.  I chop my onion a I decide in advance to leave it in the sauce and, like MC Baker, and for the same reasons, I add garlic - 3 clove chop - in step two, and basil towards the end of step two.  I also add a cup of wine, a the tomato I use don\\'t have a lot of liquid which be great: it leave room for some wine!  Made for New Zaar Stars Tag.  Thank you MarraMamba for a recipe I know that I\\'ll be use again and again.  On this occasion we use it with meatloaf. This really shouldn\\'t be a good a it is.  It\\'s too simple.  But it be very, very good.  Of course I taste it a it be simmer and think it be good, but once it be do and sit atop some pasta with a sprinkle of freshly-grated romano cheese--oh, my!  That\\'s when it really become clear just what a wonderful little sauce this is.  I love it on pasta but can also imagine it over zucchini, or fry eggplant, or herb-marinated chicken.  So simple but so delicious!  A definite keeper. Super simple and great for lot of uses.  I add garlic sometimes, olives, leftover veggies, just about anything to make it a little different.  Freezes well too! Oh Marra, I so want to love this sauce.  I have only live in 3 state and I have to say that the corner pizza store in each of these state have the same TOO sweet sauce that they use for all of their pasta recipes.  I like this sauce.  It do not taste bad. But I would not use it in any of my recipe that require a tomato sauce. This truly be a very simple sauce.    I have make it twice and I love it.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 1st time I add italian sausage and serve with ziti pasta.\\r\\n\\r\\nThe 2nd time I use the sauce in my lasagna.\\r\\n\\r\\nSince i love garlic and oregano, I add those spices, a well a a little salt and pepper.   \\r\\nThe sauce be delicious and taste so fresh!\\r\\nThanks for the recipe! I definitely love this sauce. Too simple and too good. The butter be definitely key to the recipe. I\\'ve try add basil and shrimp to it. But I like it best just the way it is. Thanks so much! I\\'ll add to the rave reviews! This sauce be so simple, and taste so good! I make it a write and add meatball at the very end. I serve it over spaghetti, and I have never think spaghetti taste so good! It\\'s simple, but so velvety on the tongue. I use Hunts dice tomatoes, and I imagine if I use good tomatoes, I would have even good results. Regardless, I have stock up on can tomato and butter so I\\'ll have this wonderful simple sauce available any time! The best thing of all, though, be that my kid and husband seem to love it a much a I, that be truly a feat. Thanks so much for posting! Simple to make, hardly any preparation, ingredient usually on hand, what more could you ask for?  I just have to try it, and I be really please with the results.  The sauce have load of flavor, and the butter be really the key, so don\\'t leave it out or substitute anything else for it. It be awesome!  It\\'s also great with fresh crack black pepper, garlic and basil add too!  Thank you for share your recipe with u Marra!  Linda This be sooo easy, and the result be amazing. Vidalia onion be in season, so I use those, and a bite of fresh basil. Served over angel hair pasta,& top with freshly grate Parmesan Reggiano, this sauce be restaurant quality! I want to try it with a few slice mushroom next time. Great recipe. I bring Marcella\\'s book via Amazon (not be from the US I didn\\'t grow up with her book etc).  I make this sauce one night and it be amaze - we just eat it  toss through pasta with a sprinkle of parmagiano on the top, just amaze (we also fight over the last two spoonful of pasta but that\\'s a whole other story!).  This be my new standby, I use it for homemade pizza etc too a a base sauce. Since my opinion diverge so sharply from everyone else\\'s, it seem fair to post a comment sans star since it may just be my tastebud at fault.  I use high-quality ingredient and follow direction to the letter.  But, in all honesty, this be a huge disappointment.  Despite my late effort to salvage the sauce (adding saute garlic, fresh basil, a splash of balsamic vinegar and lot of freshly-grated Parmesan), it still taste exactly like what it be -- a can of tomato that have be heated.  Although Marcella Hazan be a very talented chef, I would have to agree that this particular recipe be \"crazy\". When I first saw this recipe, I wonder just how good it could be with only  3 or 4 simple ingredients.  I use a 14.5oz can of dice tomatoes, which measure out to almost 2 cups.  The only onion I have be already chopped, so that\\'s what I used, otherwise I follow the recipe exactly.  As someone else also mentioned, I taste the sauce in the pan and think it be ok.   But something happen when I put it on the spaghetti...OMG!!!!  This be absolutely wonderful!   I honestly don\\'t think I\\'ll ever use any other kind of sauce for my spaghetti.   Thank you for this treasure! This have become my favorite tomato sauce. It\\'s great a it is, but I usually chop the onion and leave them in. You can also add some garlic and bail or parsley, though those be not necessary for a good sauce. I\\'ve also use it for spaghetti and meatballs. Was miss some tomato sauce for a recipe - so glad I find your recipe!! So easy and oh so tasty!! Only change I make be to use dice tomatoes. Thanks! :) I have be make this for year and still love it. It\\'s cheap, easy and delicious! I agree try it exactly a write the first time, I think you will be pleasantly surprise at how good it be like that. I think the most important thing be add enough salt/pepper ( I add a little sugar) at the beginning. It give the extra liquid the salt create time to cook out. I have make it and keep the onion in and and have remove it- I definitely prefer it remove a the flavor of the onion be now in the sauce and the onion be pretty flavorless by that point. Very nice but I simply don\\'t get the  \\'spectacular\\' reviews.  It\\'s definitely a great recipe for a week night when you\\'re exhaust and want to cook something fast, healthy and cheap so it get 4 star for that.  But the flavour doesn\\'t come close to a traditional sauce that\\'s simmer for a couple of hour with basil, etc. added. I too, like rustic girl, like the recipe but  the spectacular rat escape me. I would much rather spend a little more time and effort and go for a fresh pommodoro sauce  or that all day gravy. Some of the reviewer think this sauce be overrated..but...I use this recipe for everything...and...people rave over it. My kids, co-worker & friend beg me for this sauce on angel hair pasta and lasagne. I use two large can of Muir Glen Fire Roasted Crushed Tomatoes (whole food & health food store carry them) and add a pinch of sugar to tone down the acid. I then add about 1 1/2 lb of a combination of grind beef (or grind buffalo) combine with italian sausage that have be brown in a fry pan. I pour off the juice and add to tomatoe mixture and that\\'s it! I\\'m a vegetarian so I take about a cup of the tomatoe mixture out before add meats. It\\'s wonderful on angel hair pasta! This be the most luscious, delicious, please tomato sauce I know of. Specifically, I use a 28 ounce can of whole peel san marzano tomatoes, 5 tbsp salt butter (and I don\\'t add additional salt), and a halve onion. There be nothing more please than this sauce lightly coat on al dente pasta. Perfection. I guess all along the secret ingredient be butter.  Who knew?   I make a much large quantity of this and add pine nut and caper to the sauce.  I do her recipe with the halve onion.  I put the sauce over pasta with shrimp and mussels. That\\'s what we have for dinner tonight.  Maybe now, since I can make a great sauce, I can save money on go out to eat in the quest for the perfect sauce. I make this last night, and be get 4 star rather than 5 because I add thing against the advice of the chef. I add garlic salt, basil and oregano. I also have make meatball early in the day. I simmer these in the sauce for last 20 minutes. I use 1 can dice tomato and 1 can whole plum tomatos. I will be make this again to have with my cheese stuff shell and will be make a directed. I think I would have give this a 5 star rat if I have leave it alone. I regret the add in once sauce be simmer a while and I saw where it be going, but too late I a have already add stuff. I will review again after I make the stuff shells. This be wonderful to make, even though I have to make it after work. Few ingredients, and able to pretty much able to just let simmer while other thing get done. I just wish I have leave alone, and have be able to truly enjoy the flavor a they should have been. But I will be make this again most definetly I just make this this morning and have it over ravioli.  I use a can of Cento San Marzano tomato (label say product of Italy).<br/>This be not fabulous, OK but not outstanding.  I think when use can tomatoes, even San Marzano, the butter should be increased.  The tinny tomato taste be there and it be acidic.  But I now realize why the owner of a restaurant use to put pat of butter when heat sauce for an order.<br/>I have be know to take can tomato sauce, add some butter and chicken broth (Better than Bouillon), a pinch of basil and use that for ravioli.  <br/>I will try this again, when I can get some good tomatoes.  I don\\'t think the can do it justice. I have a ton of yellow tomato that hadn\\'t turn yellow yet after the weather turn cold so I bring them into the house to vine ripen. After cook them I put them through the food mill. To this I add the butter, garlic and onion salt, oregano, basil, salt, parsley and cayenne pepper. I simmer this for several hours. I like my sauce a little thick so I add some cornstarch to just thicken enough to coat the spoon. Wow be this good. The secret be definitely the butter. I usually add a couple Tablespoons of butter to my gravy and soup but never think of add it to the tomato sauce. Thank you so much for posting. I promise next time I\\'ll make it a written. I really enjoy this sauce - it\\'s light and a bite plain, but that\\'s what I enjoy most about it a the sauce be not the focal point of my meal.  Definitely something easy to throw together on a weeknight.  Thanks for sharing! Reasons for the 5 star:  Tasted great.  Inexpensive.&lt;br/&gt;I enjoy the flavor immensely. It do not taste like tomato out of the can to me - I&#039;ve make enough sauce that have. &lt;br/&gt;In this time of need to extend our budget - a can of tomato plus a little butter make into a great meal? Who can complain? This be wonderful and so simple. The extra cook time really turn the tomato from acidic to sweet. Lovely sauce, thank you! Simple, straight-forward, no skill required.   I have very unpleasant metallic-tasting result with Cento brand tomatoes, but the San Marzano tomato (with the white label) work for me every time.  I make no change until the end, when I add a generous squirt of the pulverize Italian herb that come in a tube in the produce case   (just like Grandma....)    No matter what I put this sauce on - pasta, frittata, calamari, store-bought! meatball - my husband seem surprise at how good it taste and suggest that I make it again.  Either the stuff be very versatile, or his memory be even bad than I thought.    Freezes well, too.   The sauce...not the husband... You think this sauce be easy? Sure.  But go to the store and buy a can of SpaghettiOs will provide you with the same flavor and be even easier. \\n\\nThis sauce be a disgrace. Remember on the rivet show call &#039;Honey Boo Boo&#039; when they mix ketchup and butter together to make their sauce?  Same thing here. \\n\\nNever trust a cook that dislike garlic. I&#039;ve be cook this sauce occasionally for years. It be simple and delicious and the flavour be wonderful. This be NOT a sauce to use in other recipes, it be only for simply combine with pasta. I have the cookbook it&#039;s from and this be very clear in that (Marcella be always very clear, her tone be like a fairly strict schoolteacher I always think!). The recent comment compare this sauce to Honey Boo Boo&#039;s &quot;sketi&quot; be purely idiotic and inappropriate - Marcella Hazan be about a far away from that a you can get. Also, Marcella do not dislike garlic but like most traditional Italian cook she do not combine onion and garlic in a pasta sauce - it&#039;s one or the other. Made this today but I use fresh heirloom tomato from my garden. Normally, the acidity would need balance but this recipe be perfection. I believe the butter give it all the balance it needed. I add meat ball in the last 15 minute and my husband cry a little tear of joy.',\n",
       " \" I make this for a picnic and serve it at room temperature and everyone like it except me ... so I heat it up and try it again and it be fantastic!!!! \\r\\nThe flavor be wonderful - I highly recommend this for people try to eat low carb.\\r\\nAs far a whether to eat hot or cold - it depend on if you're wierd like me :-) This be REALLY good!!  I serve it hot and add a few slice of deli ham (chopped)into it.  My dad be on the Atkins diet, so this be great for him along with the salad I serve with it, thanks, I wil def. be make this again...I already have request from my dad :)!! I be not in the mood to cook anything time consume tonight and want something light and relatively healthy. This turn out to be just what I be look for. Very easy to put together and my family think it be delicious. Tasted kind of like a quiche or omelet. Used Monterey Jack cheese. Thanks Theresa, will be use this one again. Easy to make! Delicious!\\r\\nEven my 6 year old who will have nothing to do with zucchini beyond zucchini bread eat every bite.\\r\\nThanks! I be a little skeptical at first but I just make this and have a taste and I be pleasantly surprised! The cayenne pepper give it a nice kick. I use green onion and Italian blend cheese. I will certainly be make this again. My family devour this--I could hardly believe it. I think I will add another egg next time; I would like a more balance egg:zucchini ratio. My 10 yr. old doesn't like zucchini. He think it be okay. I doubt he would complain about eat it again. On the other hand, I think it be excellent. My boyfriend and I go back for seconds. I will definitely be make this again and again. DELICIOUS!! I use about 1 3/4 cup shred mozzarella & 1/4 cup grate Romano cheese (we like the strong cheese taste).   I sprinkle a handful of mozzarella over the top before baking.  Also, use regular pepper instead of cayenne (had a few people who cannot have the add spice).  SOOO Yummy...My mother in law couldn't stop rave about it and ask for the recipe!  Such an easy veggie to prepare!  Thanks! Made this last night, simple, straightforward, a lovely mid-week supper dish, serve with rice, garlic mushrooms, and sweetcorn.   \\nEven my daughters, who don't care for zucchini, eat it happily (after hopefully investigate the oven for a meat dish - not tonight, girls!)\\n\\nThank you for a good recipe that I shall make again :) This be just okay for me.

I make 3 dozen perfect ghost cooky today, and 2 dozen perfect pumpkin cooky yesterday.  The cookie be a wonderful buttery/sugary cookie that be still soft when cooled.  Make sure you watch the cooky and take them out when you see the first sign of golden-brown on the bottom.  I roll and re-rolled the dough many time and all the cooky be perfect!  Thanks for a great recipe!! Lovely sugar cookies, a little difficult to roll but turn out great and make a huge amount.  I make them for a Valentine's Day afternoon tea.  Made them in different size heart shape and ice them, DH love them so do everyone else. Thanks for posting.\",\n",

I think next time I will add a bite more cream cheese and I definately recommend use 2 can of filling.   yes, this be awsome!\\r\\nI make it for my nightly dessert.\\r\\nI only make one serving, and save the rest of the ingredient for next time!\\r\\nI use fat free cream cheese and cool whip free, I even put sprinkle on top and a pinch of cinnamon. YUMMY!! Made this twice now.  \\r\\nThe first time a write except for use all low cal and fat free items-perfect and yummy! \\r\\nOnly 313 calorie and ZERO fat!\\r\\nBut when I go to make it yesterday, I find my fat-free cream cheese to be expire and it look questionable anyway.  So I improvise and use a cup of Dannon Light n Lively Vanilla Yogurt in it place. (Don't even ask me how I get creative enough to try this...but it be superb!) Plus it acually shave off about 15 MORE calorie per serving. \\r\\nDon't hesitate to try this version. I have 6 individual angel food cake that I use and instead of cherry pie fill I use apple( with Splenda) with a touch of cinnamon and chop walnuts.  The other ingredient  be no fat.  I be nice and light and lend itself to so may different combinations.  I'll use this often. How woefully remiss of me to not have rat this wonderful dessert sooner!! I've make it several time already! I do make a change, due to personal preference.  My DH do not like cream cheese, so I use 2 8 oz container of black cherry yogurt. And do use 2 can of cherry pie fill a one seem a little sparse.  Thank you for an awesome dessert!\",\n",
       " \" These cooky be very yummy! They have a slightly caramelly flavour from the white chocolate and that go great with the spice and cranberries.<br/>The oat lend the cookie a crispy texture, which we all enjoy and the sunflower seed add great crunch.<br/>I be a little absent mind while scoop the dough onto the cookie sheet and somehow my scoop must have be rather large, cause I end up with only 7 cooky from half the recipe. Those spread very much during baking, so that I have big coffee shop style cookies. Thats nice, though, too. :)<br/>I prefer these without the glaze a I find they be too sweet with it on top.<br/>Other than that though a lovely little recipe and great for share (which I already did).<br/>THANK YOU SO MUCH for share your creation with u and good luck in the contest! I think the use of contest ingredient be really creative and we look forward to try these.  For the most part they're okay, but my family just prefer a soft cookie.  These be quite crumbly, dry and not sweet enough for our taste; even with the drizzle of icing.  I wish we have enjoy them more, but be really glad we try them.  Thanks for share your creation, chef!  :)  Good luck in the contest! These be easy to make and be quite tasty. I make some without the glaze, and find we prefer those.  We think the glaze make them just a little too sweet for our taste, but they certainly look pretty with it.  After I make the 24 cooky use a 1 teaspoon scoop, I still have plenty of dough left.  I switch to the tablespoon scoop, and get another 24 cookies. :) I like the large cooky better.  I know...shouldn't make a difference, but to my warp mind it did.  Made for the 2010 Craze-E Category Contest.  Good luck and thank for participating. Loved these little tasties, especially with the chocolate & cranberry combo, but then that my addiction show through! I do use a large scoop than the teaspoon suggest & still get over 2 dozen cookies! They be make mostly for my other half to share at a weekly group, but I keep 4 back for a simple taste test, & yes, I need 4 to make an accurate test! Definitely a nice keeper of a recipe!

       " ' My church be have a Chili contest and I be ask to enter it b/c not many people have enter the contest, so I did. My husband said, have you ever make chili before and I say no and he start laughing. I be look for a recipe and find this one and make it for the contest and out of 7 entry I win First Place and everyone love it!!!!!! Great Recipe to make!!!!!!!!  I be skeptical about use can French Onion soup, but be very please with the result of this chili.  I do not have tomato paste, so I use crush tomato w/ puree, and it be great.  I love the cumin flavor, but do substitute Cayenne pepper for the black pepper, and also add a touch more chili powder a well a a TBS of salt (liquid from the tomato probably dilute it a bit).  Keeper recipe.  I\\'ll make this when I don\\'t have 4 hour to simmer my other recipe. What a nice twist on chili.  I\\'m go to try the crush tomato next time and maybe a little bite of bell pepper.  I love the french onion soup in it!! Thanks! Not bad for something so quick and easy.  I throw this together for my husband to eat while watch football. I use a 15 oz can of tomato sauce and a 12 oz can of tomato paste instead of use the small size can that the recipe call for. And I use a small size can of beans--probably around 15 oz.  I haven\\'t have Wendy\\'s chili in a very long time, so I don\\'t know how this compares, but this be a good, quick chili recipe that I would make again. So easy and quick to make!  and tasty too!!!  I use 2 16 oz can of kidney bean instead of 21 oz, and I didn\\'t have tomato sauce so I use a 16 oz can of dice tomatoes, undrained.  Everyone love it!  This be my chili recipe from now on!  First let me say this be a great recipe...most of u sometime tweak thing for own preference or with what we have on hand and I do just that. I use 2 lb gr. beef and do not puree the onion soup. instead of kidney bean I use a mix of chili bean and no bean chili. all else same. simmer a while and freeze half. serve with toast cheese. thank for a quick flexible recipe. oh so good! A keeper!  Simple ingredients, quick to make, and DELICIOUS.  No need to puree the French onion soup...it all blend together just fine.  Perfect for a chilly December night!  Thanks!  My chili hunt be over. A very quick and easy recipe.  Also very good!  I do not puree the soup and don\\'t think it make any difference.  I use just 1 pound of grind beef and double the amount of beans.  A keeper! Thanks Wow!  This chili be great!  I wouldn\\'t change a thing!  (I take everyone\\'s advice and didn\\'t puree the onion soup..came out perfect.)  Thanks for share this recipe. we do this recipe along with 2 others and I forget to write down my comment so review a a try recipe I follow the recipe exactly. It be good and do seem somewhat like Wendy\\'s Chili, but it seem too thick and too tomato tasting. I believe this be due to the tomato paste. I be go to keep look at other Wendy\\'s Chili Clone recipes. I enter in a chili cook-off  with this and won! The recipe be good but I think it might have be miss some spices. It felt too tomatoey with the tomato paste and didn\\'t have the kick I be expect from Wendy\\'s. I use grind turkey but otherwise follow the recipe. I didn\\'t process the onion soup and the whole thing be at a simmer in about 15 minutes. Loved how easy and quick it be to put together. Thanks! I enter a chili contest @ my church in 2006 and have never make chili before. So, I go on here to find a recipe and find this one. I look over the ingredient list and say ok, find one. I make the chili and take it to the contest and win FIRST PLACE!!!!! In 2007 my church have another contest and I have to make my chili again and I win FIRST PLACE AGAIN! This be a GREAT Recipe!!!!! OMG, I be amaze at how good this is, and how easy!  Normally we add more spice, but this be great, I hardly have any leftover for just the 2 of us.  This be not bland at all, but it doesn\\'t interfere with medication or the like (at this point at least.)  Thanks for share this recipe, Tinkerbell!  Made for Photo Tag. Oh wow....the family\\'s new favorite chilli recipe.  DH love Wendy\\'s chili and so I just know this would go over in a big way for him.  I\"ve never make chilid use french onion soup and so this must..it just must be the secret ingredient.  I\"m not a meat eater, but the smell be heavenly while this be simmer away on the stove-top.  A real keeper Tink.\\r\\nMade for HolidayTag. Very very very good chili! Not Wendys, but great! I add a can of chili bean a well. Not Wendy\\'s chili but good. I believe that Wendy\\'s chili have pepper in it and be a lot more soupy. This chili be thick, more like for top hot dogs. I add more season and some chicken bullion. This be easy and tasty, it a keeper. Thanks for posting! Tasty chili in a flash. Not a veggie to be peel and chopped, just open cans. I add like 1/4 cup dice green chilies. As prepared. I be not impressed.  Bland a is.',\n",

The parfait be so creamy and not overly tart. Very simple and quick to make too. Soooo good! I love lemon and fluffy dessert and strawberry and ,I guess, everything about this! I be a little short on strawberry (thanks to my kid snitching...) so I glaze the top layer with lemon curd so it would look more full. This be wonderful. Thanks! Very yummy, and easy, this recipe give me a reason to learn to make lemon curd. It be easy and delicious. I add in some grham cracker crumb in with they parfait layer to make it interesting. Served it in a margarita glass! Not too sweet, not too tart, just right! Very tasty and light!  I make some lemon curd last week that need to be use up, and this be a perfect way to use it.  It be enjoy by all, and it be so pretty!!!  Thanks Leslie! OMIGOSH - this be SOOO good.  I macerate the strawberry in a little sugar and some triple sec for a few hours, but this would have be scrumptious even with the berry plain.

It be the coconut that make me try it and I wasn't disappointed. I be relunctant to rate it though, because I make a rather large change. I do not like blend soup, so I chop spinach and potato and take about 1.5 time the amount of them give in the recipe to make the soup thick without have to blend it.

       " \" Now let me tell you ~ this be an OUTSTANDING chicken recipe!! Yes, I take liberty with it, in that (1)I don't have a grill [believe it or not!]; (2)I cut back on the hot pepper sauce [though next time I'll use the indicate dosage!]; (3)I'm a chicken breast lover, so...; & (4)I make twice a much of the marinade/sauce a indicate [I like that kind of thing over brown rice]! Anyway, it all come together very nicely, with a combination of bake & broiling! Very tasty; very, very nice! Many thanks! I might be a day late in add something that should have be include before, but it be bring to my attention that I didn't include my bake process ~ Well, I follow the recipe to the point of grilling, then bake the breast for 35 minute at 375 degree F, before put them under the broiler JUST LONG ENOUGH to brown them a little. They be serve drench with the extra sauce I'd made! We love this chicken.  I marinate it for 8 hours, then I bake it (at 375*) in the sauce because I didn't want to lose any of that great sauce.  I add a pinch of grind clove to the sauce, but no other change be made.  I did, however, totally forget to garnish with the green onions..... great anyway.  I will make this again; in the oven and or on the grill.  Thanx! gosh this be a great chicken recipe, I marinate the chicken for 24 hours, and I increase the cayenne and garlic, I can see this sauce use for baste chicken while grill and that be what I be go to do in the future! thank for share Cheesehead!...Kitten:) DH grill drumstick that I have marinate overnight. He baste the chicken while grill and I be sorry to say this didnt have the flavor that I be hop for with all the five star reviews. There be more of a soy sauce asian flavor, the cherry and dijon flavor really do not come thru. I do not add the hot pepper sauce or green onion before serving. The chicken drumstick be moist and tender and I will try this again bake it in the oven and baste so hopefully I will get the result the other review did. This be great. I be skeptical at first, but i recently have a great steak marinaide with grape jelly so i give it a shot. The ONLY cherry preserve i could find be a 9.5 oz jar of bing cherry spreadable fruit - which make everything sorta a deep red/purple color. I didnt print out the recipe so i didnt even notice you be suppose to heat up the mixture first - didnt seem to hurt it any tho. I make some change - i didnt have dijon mustard so i use 1 tbsp of spicy brown mustard plus 1 tbsp honey, and use 1/4 tsp cayenne pepper instead of hot sauce and regular soy sauce. I throw half in with the chicken to sit overnight in a plastic bag, turn it twice and the rest in a bowl to brush while cooking. When I cook it i sorta follow Sydney Mikes advice, and throw it in a dish at 375 for 17 minute and brush with the sauce, then drain the dish, flip and repeted. While that be cook i heat up what i have save so the preserve would melt (like i be suppose to in the first place lol), then transfer to a broil pan and give each side a generous brush and 3 minute under the broiler. Next time i will grab another jar of preserves, because the sauce be really good and i would have love some more slather on after cooking, but i dont like to use the extra from marinade for anything. This isnt a sweet a i be anticipateing, which be great, everyone love it and i will make again.\",\n",

BUT I want a new & spec potato dish I could proudly serve to guests. These potato be special - rich, flavorful & definitely company-worthy. They should be the star of a meal & not be serve when another sauce be a part of the menu. Meat from the grill seem like the ideal pairing. Oven temp & cook time be spot-on, but I would suggest tent the top of the bake dish w/foil for the 1st 20 min (or so) of the cook time. Mine be a tad dark on top in spots. Thx for share this great recipe w/us. :-) Luxurious and delicious! I agree with twissis, these be not an everyday side dish, but they be definitely worth the occasional splurge! I have find some nice rock lobster tail at Costco, so I grill those up to serve with these potatoes. I use some tiny yukon gold potatoes, so I quarter them lengthwise to get tiny wedges. I didn't have a problem with the top get too dark, but maybe it's because my potato be so tiny that they start off cover in the cream mixture. Edited to add: I almost forgot, I use fresh parsley in place of the flake because I have so much on hand. Thanks for posting! Made by a Honey for ZWT8 France Really great recipe.  I add 8 oz of fresh slice mushrooms.  Klondike golden small potato work really well for this.\",\n",

I, personally, love the contrast of flavor of the salad a post and will make this again and again. I make this for company.  The dress be a lovely pink. Toasting the pecan make all the difference!  This salad be definitely a keeper.  Make sure to toss with the lettuce RIGHT before serving.  You don't want a salad this good to get soggy! This be an excellent salad.  Very summery and refreshing.  I use olive oil, and white wine vinegar because I have them on hand.  I wish I hadn't put the whole batch of dress in at once, it be a little heavy on the (delicious) dressing.  Next time I will start with half and see if I need more. Such a simple salad, but so pretty, and so tasty. The dress make twice a much a I needed, but all to the good because we will glady have this salad again today.

Served it with brown rice.....the sauce be great with it a well. All the right ingredient be there, but the finish product be not something I will attempt again. The flavor wasn't quite there. Thinking maybe it need some garlic powder season the fish with the salt and pepper. I don’t have a photo but it look fine. I love the sauce! I think I might want to try it a bite sweet next time. The thing I don’t understand be that the dish have a definite and for me unpleasant bitterness to it. I don’t think it be the sauce, and I know my olive oil be okay so I think it must have be the fish. I haven’t cook rockfish before - I just saw it at Costco and think “oh that might be fun to try!”. Is there something weird about rockfish? The sauce be amazing! I use a dry white wine and the caper and lemon add just the right amount of spice to elevate a bland fish. My local market provide very fresh fish which be also a key to the success of this recipe. I be go to try this sauce recipe with crab and chicken a well. My husband isn't a fan of fish, particularly strong-tasting ones. When rockfish be on sale at our Whole Foods, I decide to give it a try, think I would cook it pan fry with a piccata sauce.

Next time I will read the recipe more carefully. I didn&#039;t change anything else, except add 1/4 teaspoon orange oil. I don&#039;t know what be responsible, but the bread do make nice orangey taste toast. My only advice for someone use this recipe be to be careful of how much flour to use, and stop when the dough be kneadable. Thank you very much for share this recipe with us. I love the orange-cinnamon flavor.',\n",
       " \" This be great!! I'm not a huge coleslaw fan and neither be my grandson, but I have some leftover cabbage and decide to try this. So glad that I did. We both enjoy it immensely. It taste like a Waldorf salad with cabbage. Thanks Rumdrinker25 for a great side dish. Made for Bargain Basement Tag. I use part yogurt and part mayo for the dressing. I also toast the walnut and keep them separate until serve so they would stay crunchy. Very good! [Made for the All You Can Cook Buffet] I have the raisin sit on the counter and totally miss them! Oh well, it lighten the sugar level a bite and the slaw be perfectly yummy any way, lol. I use a Gala apple with the skin leave on, Splenda for the Tbsp of sugar and pecans. Really delicious salad. :D Sweet and sassy spot on - I take the easy way out and use a slaw mix (red and green cabbage and carrot) and then add the other ingredient with the exception of the walnut I use pencans but the final result be a lovely fresh and fullof flavour fresh slaw.  Thank you <br/>Rumdrinker25, make for I Recommend tagg game and recommend by lazyme.\",\n",
       " ' I love hop johns, and this definitely do not disappoint!  I finally lucked out and find can black-eyed pea in the new Whole Foods store that open nearby.  We be vegetarians, so instead of real bacon we use a bacon substitute.  We cut back on the butter and serve with extra hot sauce.  We make this a one dish meal, it be excellent!  Thank you.  Will be eat leftover for lunch today at work.',\n",
       " ' This soup be very good, I didn\\'t have navy bean or black-eyed peas, so I use butter bean and kidney bean for those two.  Other than that no changes.  Both me and DH like it.  Added shred cheddar cheese on top with some cracker and tobasco.  Perfect on a cold rainy night like tonight. Great taste. I would cut down on the ranch dress mix b/c it taste a bite too salty after all the can beans. Then the sour cream at the end can be mix in to give it that milky look / flavor. I do not feel like cook this come in handy a can be. Had everything but the black beans. We love this. Has a good spicey taste. I add some celery and bell pepper and carrots. Topped with sour cream and tortilla chips. Very Good. I serve this at a party and it be a big hit! It\\'s easy to make and it taste great. This be wonderful!  I couldn\\'t find the kidney beans, so I add hominy instead.  Topped it off with sour cream and a little cheese and it be great! This soup be fabulous and so easy to make. All those different bean give an interest flavor and appearance. The season with the taco mix and ranch mix be quite good. We eat on this a couple of day and then I freeze the rest for later. Thanks Junebug. My family and I love this soup. What a great soup!  We love this soup just like the recipe, but the second time I make it UN-vegetarian (sorry!) by add two skinless chicken breasts, grill and season with chili powder, then shredded.  Also throw in some bell pepper and a little cilantro, and use the spicy rotel.  Very delicious top with sour cream, a little cheese, and chips. Made this up for fourteen of my co-worker for lunch.  Everybody love it!  I have to double it to accomodate everybody, but that be simple! (I put it all together in about 15 minutes, then cook it for three hour in a crock pot.)\\r\\nI would recommend this dish for any group, large or small!  Well done! I make this recipe and allow it to sit until dinnertime, roughly 2+ hours. I let my family know there be condiment on hand they may want to add (cheese, chip and sour cream) and off I go to work. Shortly after dinner, I receive an enthusiastic email from my family praise this recipe. Thanks Junebug! This recipe be a Mom\\'s best friend. Mmmmmm.  This soup be quick, easy, and very filling!  I\\'ll be make this often!   Have be extremely busy lately and this recipe help me out. I can\\'t remember when I have make something this easy--just require open up a few can and packets. I make it in the crockpot so I could go take care of some errand while it be cooking. I use hot-n-spicy Rotel because we like plenty of zing. I divide the soup into individual serve container and put them in the freezer. My husband and I take this for lunch a couple of day this week. Very tasty and I sprinkle a little cheddar on top and eat mine with tortilla chips. Thanks Junebug--this one be great for OAMC.  This be delicious and so easy!  I add a chop carrot, which go well with it.  My husband say this be his new favorite soup, after I serve it with cheddar cheese and a spoon of sour cream on top.  I also freeze some individual serve which reheat very well.  Awesome! Wonderful! I think I would be brave and use hot taco seasoning. Wow it be hot! Perfect if you like spice. I couldn\\'t find rotel so I have to leave it out, which work out fine. I add a little garlic salt and fresh grind pepper. I be so glad there be leftover to eat the rest of the week. Served with cheddar and fritos on top. Thanks, Junebug! Great soup.  It taste a lot like my vegetarian chili, but a lot thick with more veggies.  I have a ton of stuff to do yesterday, so I spend only about ten minute throw this together and let it simmer on the stave while I get my stuff done!  Great!  I follow the recipe exactly--perfect! This be so easy to make and taste great.  A definite keeper! Thanks for share this recipe Junebug! Thank you! This be a wonderful recipe. Very easy to make and wonderful a leftovers. I leave out the onion and also add spicy rotel. Fantastic recipe!  My husband and I temporarily have some serious diet restriction (no dairy/eggs, meat, oil) and this be one of the few recipe that fit the bill!  I\\'ve be eat it three day in a row.  It\\'s very chili like, especially since I sub chili for taco seasoning.  Thanks! This be just ok to me.  It\\'s a good soup but I guess just wasn\\'t my thing.  Easy to make though. My BF have this soup at a coworker\\'s house when he be on a business trip in Texas, get the recipe for me before I join \\'zaar, then I find the recipe here too which give me the impetus to finally make it.  Now I can say we both love it!!!  If you don\\'t have rotel available where you live (we don\\'t) just substitute any can of tomato and chile from the Mexican section of the grocery store.  Needless to say, this be a fantastic dish to serve to company and very, very popular too! I have to admit I be a little sketchy after look at the ingredient but after read all the review I decide to try it anyway- wow, what a pleasant surprise! I love it! The EASIEST thing I\\'ve ever make I think. I can see this become a staple in our house. Thanks for sharing!!!  Expecting vegetarian guest for the weekend, I agonize over what to make in order not to offend there palates.  This be an instant hit!  I make the recipe exactly a post and serve a warm cheese bread for dipping.  To please my meat-lover DH, I make Tiny Taco Meatballs a one of the \"condiments\" so he could add the meat factor into his bowl.  Thanks so much for help me show my guest a good time!  This go in my Soup-Keepers cookbook! Thanks SO much for this! As a vegetarian in an omni family, this be something we all enjoyed! Yummy spicy flavor :) I teach a high school food class and we be study legumes.  We make this recipe, top with sour cream, cheese, Tobasco sauce and tortilla chips.  While making, the student weren\\'t too sure about the look of it.  Not a single student in the class of 25 dislike it.  I\\'ve never find a recipe so well like by all the students.  It be easy to make, start the first one hour period and reheat the next day. Many of the student request a second copy of the recipe to take home! Great job! This merit five star for both taste and ease of preparation.  Every week from late September until late March I have \"soup night\" at my house for friend and family.  I make one pot of an old favorite and try one new recipe.  Tonight I decide to try this because many of my friend stay away from meat during Lent.  Everyone love it--even the picky eaters.  This will definitely go into the regular rotation.  Thanks for a great recipe Junebug--I\\'m go to look for more of your recipes. I love this soup. So do DH. I do not use the ranch dress packet because the first ingredient on it be salt. I do use a low sodium version of taco season which be very spicy. It have the kick and comfort we need on this cold winter day in the midwest.  Edited to say, I\\'m sorry, I would have give it 5 star if I have remembered. This be very easy to make.  In fact, my 13 year old be the one who make it for dinner.  The only suggestion my child have be to leave out the green bean next time. i would have never think in my life to use ranch dress . this be great . only thing i do be use fresh green bean and some green pepper . thank junebug\\r\\n  it even good the next day!!! One of my family\\'s favorite soups. DS cannot get enough. He keep ask for it. Thanks. This be a great gluten-free recipe- just make sure to check the taco season and the ranch dress mix. I think this be great.  It\\'s not a lot of liquid for all of those ingredients, so if you want it more soupy, you would probably want to add more liquid.  I use the 4 type of bean I have on hand - black, pinto, white, and kidney.  I use dry onion and regular rotel.  Everything else be to spec.  I serve with quesadilla wedge and sour cream and cheese.  I think it be a delicious and easy meal and so do my 1 yr old.  Leftovers be quite thick a the liquid have dry up, so I have to add more water to make it soupy again, but it still taste fine and have enough seasoning. I make this recipe for a soup sale and it be a big hit!  I love that the soup be vegetarian and simmer the soup bring the flavor together.  I do double the recipe and do without the green beans.  Thanks for share Junebug! I have make this for many, many people and one baby shower.  Everyone love it and want the recipe! Excellent! And I\\'m not even a vegetarian! :) I make it exactly a directed. very good, and so easy. My super-carnivore husband eat two bowl and love it. I want to serve the rest for lunch during the week, so I have to hide it!\\n\\nIt be too spicy for my kids, so next time I will use mild rotel, or sub plain tomatoes. Great!  Used to eat a chicken taco soup in my pre-vegetarian days, and since go meat-free, decide to try and find a similar version.  Wow - I think this be just a good if not good than the old soup I use to love.  This be now my new favorite meal - cook in a crockpot the first night, then take some for leftover throughout the week and even have enough to freeze some more.  Perfect with sour cream, shred cheese, and tortilla chip (small bite-sized white round be the best to spoon it up!). Outstanding and so easy! :) This be so salty it be inedible.  With this much sodium, there\\'s no way you can call this healthy.  I end up strain off all the broth and start over in order to avoid throw it all away.  If you want to try this recipe, I would recommend add the ranch dress mix and taco season a little at a time and taste a you go. I use this for a couple of vegetarian co workers.  Everyoneone just love it!!!!  With ONLY 712mg sodium not much salt at all.  help if you dont add your own salt and spoil a recipe This be a good soup, and pretty easy to prepare.  I find I personally don\\'t like the flavor of black-eyed peas, so I would leave them out if I make this again.  The ranch dress be what make this soup good--don\\'t skimp on that.   I rinse my bean so it wasn\\'t too salty.  I didn\\'t have pinto or navy beans, so I use a can of white kidney (cannellini) beans, and the rest be black beans.  I serve with a dollop of fat free sour cream on top and that be really good. I\\'m a bite of wuzzie for heat so even with the mild rotel tomato this be plenty hot.  This be tasty and very filling.  I eat one measure cup a a lunch portion and I\\'m get much more than 8 servings.  I didn\\'t add the black-eyed peas.  Not something I have on hand.  Used an extra can of some beans, I think black bean and I use cannelini beans.  Very good. What a kick this had! I only use black and pinto bean and add some green chilies. I use more/less of a lot of the ingredient a well since I sight measured. Very good. I never think I would try this recipe a we love our meat, but this be really good.  A friend of mine try it and have me taste, so delicious.   I be plan on make it for my family next week so hope they like a much a i did.  The veggie be a nice alternative to the meat.  Thank you for post and open my eye to more food. Simple soup, easy to prepare with wonderful flavor!  I use low sodium vegetable broth instead of water and cannellini bean instead of the pinto, a that be what I have on hand. Otherwise I make this recipe a directed.  I sprinkle with crush blue corn tortilla chip and a little shred Monterey Jack cheese.  We will most definitely make this again.  Thank you, Junebug! Very quick, very tasty, spicy, and make A LOT! Left out the green bean since I didn\\'t have any on hand. Used Rotel with Lime and Cilantro, and Margaret Holmes Seasoned Pinto Beans un-rinsed. Topped with sour cream, slice green onion and sharp cheddar. Ate so much I be miserable.................but couldn\\'t wait to have it again for lunch the next day ;o) Ok, well for some reason I can get my star rat to work but.  I easily give this 4.5 stars. I be really just get start with eat vegetarian so it a journey.  I follow the recipe completely except for green bean and black eye pea (didn\\'t have them) after read other review I also rinse and rinse and rinse the beans, I also use low sodium taco season after this it be still a bite salty, but cheese help tone it down.  Wonderful recipe, even our teenager  go back for more!! For a single guy, who doesn&#039;t cook and want to eat healthy, this be a perfect and very easy soup to make...absolutely LOVE IT!!!!  Highly recommend...thank you!!!! Super easy and filling. I be hop for a little more flavor so I might try use veggie broth instead of water. Thanks for share the recipe!',\n",

Made for Newest Zaar Tag. I love this breakfast.  I do health it up a bit.  I use a lean cuisine pasta dish, egg beaters, and cook spray.  So yummy and only about 360 calorie with like 25 gram of protein.  So good.  I  will be have this again.  Thanks Noo. Excellent.  I have just make it and now have lunch for tomorrow!\\n\\nThanks again! This be easy to make and taste very good.  I have no leftover spaghetti, so I have to cook some.  Drained the spaghetti, put it back in the pan, add sauce, cheese and the egg then stir it all together.  Put this in my cast iron skillet and it brown nicely.  I think I\\'ll add some saute onion next time.  Thanks for a delicious lunch.  Made for *1 2 3 Hit Wonders 2009* game I love this. It be so simple and very tasty. I love anything pasta so I know this would be a winner! Thanks for sharing. Made for Gimme 5 tag. Very enjoyable, and delicious.  It be also easy to make.  The kid be surprise by this, this morning.  Made for Zaar Stars. It\\'s impossible to make spaghetti sauce for two, without leftover and get \"spaghettied out\".  Great new way to use up the LO\\'s.  I do health it up with egg beater & pam, though.  Next experiment will be to use the leftover spaghetti squash! Great use for leftover pasta.  I use some leave over angel hair.  I didn\\'t have any sauce so i pore a quarter bottle of salsa into the mix.  Came out nicely.  Thanks Great idea for leftover spaghetti! Ours be in a tomato and mascarpone sauce which go so well with the cheese and egg mix. Will definitely make this again! My grandma use to make this alot. I sometimes adapt the recipe for a great dinner main dish.  I include any and all pizza topping that I have on hand, save the cheese for the top, and prepare it like a pizza after the initial turn,  place it in the oven for a few minutes. Great recipe, economical, and all in one pan too !',\n",

I be happy to find a crab recipe without the shell and be eager this would work but it didn't taste right at all. I buy a good brand of curry powder too from my grocer.

This be WAY easy than I anticipate after just a cursory glance at the directions.  I leave out the bacon because I think I have it and discover I didn't, and I leave out the olive because nobody here like them.  Otherwise I make just a direct and serve over pasta.

It be a whole grain flour, but much soft and bake up beautifully. It be also gluten-free for most people, although there be some who be sensitive to even oatmeal. Interesting note - friend with European connection who tell me that there be virtually no gluten issue there - could it be the way we process our grain in North America that cause the problem?

       " ' Made this just the other night. Thought it sound very interest and original. I be not disappointed. This be very good, creamy fudge that be not overly sweet. I love the color. My stave doesn\\'t heat too well so it take a bite long to cook and I use a candy thermometer. Definitely great for the summer! I make this yesterday because it sound intrigue and I have a boatload of fresh-picked strawberry to use up. I have to admit, the five star be primarily for flavor (wonderful!), because I\\'m not sure that mine come out right, texture-wise. I use a thermometer and cook it to 234ºF. Instead of a solid fudge, I end up with a pan of lovely pink chewy strawberry toffee. It doesn\\'t really hold it\\'s shape when cut, but it taste great! I\\'m not exactly a candymaker, and I\\'ve hear that real fudge be kind of hard to make (as oppose to quick fudge with can milk), so I may have just do something wrong. At any rate, it\\'s still a yummy candy. I\\'ll have to try it again to see if I can get it to at least be solid. And if not, I\\'ll just have another pan of strawberry toffee, no big deal. Thanks for posting!  Tasty and pretty! This be a great way to use up strawberry that be on their way out. Thanks! I don\\'t know what I do wrong but it never get pas 220 degree for me.  I\\'m heart-sick because I use premium, juicy, freshly pick strawberry from Eckert\\'s in IL.  When I add the lemon juice to the boil mixture, it curdled.  That be not a good indicator, in my book.  Save yourself a lot of TIME and disappointment and make some \"Cinnamon Glazed Strawberries\" to serve over vanilla ice cream instead!',\n",

       " \" This be fun for the kid and I to do. We felt that it be a bite thick though. I end up add almost 1/4 cup more milk and it didn't really change. We didn't add in any chocolate this time. We dip chunk of banana, marshmallow and jam wrap in. Bananas be the hand down favourite! This be neat to do. Thanks for posting!  UPDATE: I figure out what the problem was!  We be try to just use a pot on the stove.  I be sure that if we be to use a Little Dipper or something, it would work great!  I have one on my Christmas list.  I will definitely make this again if I get one! I find this to be perfect except i marinate beef cub in butter with salt, pepper, garlic powder, and onion powder then i dip the beef into the peanut butter fondue. It be excellent! I make this last night. It come out so delicious. I have to add more milk to the mix in order to get it creamier. I just make this and find it to be very delicious!! I did, though, have to add more milk which didn&#039;t make much of a difference. It be still very thick in the end but have great taste!

THis coleslaw be a winner with my whole family. Nice fresh flavours. Thanks Galley Wench. Photo also be post I'm so glad I find this recipe. This coleslaw be so delicious and different from all the other coleslaw recipe on here. I'll make this one again and again. I don't like the coleslaw mix so I shred cabbage and carrots. I also add a tiny bite of garlic because I love it so much. Made for ZWT5 Very different! This be not a heavy calorie lade mayo drip mess! This be light and fresh and Muy Delicioso! Do use fresh lime because it be really showcased here! This have just a touch of sweet that balance so well with the tartness of the lime. This be so fresh and yummy! I have a new favorite! Thank you Galley Wench! *Made for ZWT 5* I wasn't crazy about this for some reason.  I LOVE cilantro AND lime, especially together, so I think it would be just my thing.  It wasn't bad, just not my cup of tea, I guess.  Thanks for sharing!!  :O) Yes, I like this very much and I'm not surprise because I love cilantro, lime and mayo-less coleslaw!! I make half this afternoon and serve with sloppy joe's and I keep thinking, 'this would be so great with Mexican food, fajita's, chimi's or ...'  I think your thought about this yummy coleslaw will vary by what your serve along with it - I plan to make it again! I add a bite of fresh grind pepper to the dress before tossing. Made for ZWT5. Delicious and fresh! Just the light non-mayo coleslaw I be look for.\\n\\nIt's light enough, in fact, that I be able to add extra lime juice and olive oil for more flavor, and still not weigh it down. I also chop up some fresh jalapeno pepper and throw it in--went great with the other flavors. Thank you! Boring. Ate it....but still bored.......\",\n",

I do notice on the picture that the garlic also look blue. Also the recipe do not say how long to wait before tasting. Excellent recipe. Instead of use garlic cloves( I try this before and notice they turn blue and also didn't add that much garlic flavor)Iused dry mince garlic. I also add yellow mustard seed,black peppercorns, and red pepper flakes. They turn out so good. Like a claussen but fresher. Shelf life on this recipe anybody?\",\n",

Made 1 hard-boiled egg and sit down to enjoy a delicious, healthful lunch with a toasted, whole-wheat pita.  Thanks. A very tasty salad that ccan be the basis for some interest variations. I use chickpea that I cook myself, and I pull them out of the crockpot and douse them with the dressing. I think I would add some chop parsley or thyme, to punch up the flavor a bit. I do not use the cream cheese, it just do not sound appealing, but I might try some manchego or mozzarella. I also think that add some fresh veggie would be a nice variation - fresh dice tomato or zucchini.\",\n",
       " ' Lovely simple sauce and very versatile - this be something that everyone should learn to make properly.   May I make a suggestion re fresh basil - after your sauce a come to a simmer place the chop basil on top (DO NOT STIR) and leave it there until the sauce be cook - then stir thru. go to finally try this, but add SUGAR at the end to get it just right, i like it a little sweet.  So simple tho, this be a great sauce, TESTING again too. DH said, \"I hope you NEVER buy jar sauce again!\"  You\\'ve get to love a simple sauce that taste like summer in Italy (well, what I imagine Summer in Italy would taste like!)  I think the key be to just bring the garlic to sizzle, not to brown it or overcook it.  I be will to bet this would be out of this world if make with fresh summer tomato warm from the sun!

       " ' Really a classic recipe and my favorite kind; you can mix and match ingredient and it\\'s always new and delicious. I follow this recipe to the letter, use the arborio rice and optional cream. But I can see it with thyme or oregano; pine nut or almonds; all kind of mushrooms. The risotto technique here be perfect; the only thing I\\'d change be add some garlic and/or maybe more shallots. But a \"risotto\", this be the real thing. Thank you! Mmmm this be worth every minute of time and effort which really wasn\\'t all that much!! It have the most mouthwatering taste, buttery and rich with the cheese and cahews. We love it, the instruction be very clear and easy to follow. I have some home make chicken broth in the freezer I used, it take about 3 cups, just a little more than call for, but could be because it be home make instead of canned.  In any case it be very delicious and I will be make it again, thank for share it and good luck in the contest!! Thia be my very first attempt at make risotto but I be always game to try new things. I have to really search out the arborio rice a I have never even hear of that type before. Your instruction be write very well and I have no difficulty with the technique. I add the cream to make it creamy. I don\\'t know if I will make this often a I find it very labour intensive and the fact that I be the only one in my family who like this but I be still give it 5 star because I be also the only mushroom lover in the house too :) Thanks for share and good luck! Easy to make.  I use homemade chicken broth and unsalted cashew though, because I have to be on a low salt- diet for high blood pressure. The veggie & herb give plenty of taste, even without a lot of salt. I make this risotto exactly a written.I even use my parmigiano-reggiano (which be like gold here - $48 kg). I couldn\\'t find baby portabello\\'s so use large one that I first cut in half and then slice - the strong mushroom flavour be wonderful. The addition of the lemon zest and cashew at the end add depth to the flavour of the risotto.  Oh - and I add the cream :). Best risotto we\\'ve ever had!!! Liked the overall recipe, and really like the addition of the cashew (nice touch), though the cream be a little bite of an overkill. Wow...  do this disappear quickly... Everyone love the combination of flavor and keep mention taste something different all through the meal... They also like the cashew crunch in the rice.  Wonderful creation.  Thanks  I make a call for. I would have add the basil at the same time a the both at step #7. I find it to turn black.Not eye appealing. I would also low the heat to medium when you start to add the broth. Keeping it to just a low boil.The flavor of the lemon and cheese keep knock each other out. But beside that I find this to be nice and creamy, rich, and crunchy. If I be to make again I wouldn`t add the lemon zest. This have lot of flavor go on your taste bud will be alive! This be a very nice risotto. The mushroom give it a nice flavour a do the lemon zest and wine.  I love the richness the cream added. Before I start this recipe, I read it over very carefully to determine the sodium content;  it impress me a have an excessive amount from four source in the recipe.  salt;  can chicken broth;  grate cheese;  salt cashews.  I have home- make chicken broth in my freezer with much le salt than commercial brands.   That solve one problem.   \\r\\nThen I eliminate the 1/4 tsp addion, because there be sufficient  salt in the  cheese, and salt cashews... The addition of lemon zest, and dry white wine more than make up for the elimination of salt.  Chef, you give u a choice of whether or not to use cream.. I prefer the risotto without the addition of cream.  \\r\\nI must say the combination of flavour from the dry and wet ingredient in this Nutty Mushroom Risotto make everyone hold up their plat for MORE. It seem the elimination of salt do not compromise chef\\'s intent.  I love nut of any description; next time I make this dish, perhaps  I will consider pine nuts, or perhaps almonds.  In summary, chef, and in my opinion, your Nutty Mushroom Risotto be a winner, and I plan to serve it on Sunday... Excellent!  What a great mushroom recipe!  I use vegetable broth, increase the amount of mushrooms, and omit the cream because it be rich enough without it.  I do not like the way the cashew go with the recipe so next time I will omit them too.   Nov 8 2006  I make this when we have missionary over for dinner so I didn\\'t use wine, but otherwise follow the recipe to a T.  It be a hit!  The texture be awesome!  The rice be firm, the nut crunchy, the mushroom soft.  I love the flavor lay that also go into it.  The mushroom and nut compliment eachother very well.  This be be repeat and have a place in my permanent cookbook.\\n\\n9-16-07  I try this with the wine since the above and it make a WORLD of difference.  And please use fresh parmesan cheese.  I serve this with focaccia, steam veggies, and it be a huge hit. well, this be perfect. I have great fun make it, it do not take too long time and it be absolutly delicious! Like get it serve in a decent italian restaurant...it felt sooo good! Especially with automn rain and storm. Perfect!\\r\\nThe only thing i want to ask be about the servings. Either you american have drasticly minimize your serve size or my cup be some small then yours. I pretty much fallowed the recipy a such and my boyfriend and me be very do but still not stuffed. I be slim and he be on WW...oh-oh wow if I could have give more stars, I would have. This be the rist time I make risotto, and it be perfect- I make a few minor changes- substitute regular onion for shallots, and use I cant believe it not butter for the butter, no cream, and leave off the cashews, and it be amazing.  I hightly recommend this dish to anyone- we will definitely make it again very soon!  Thanks! Loved this.  I add a package of dry lobster mushroom and morrels and the color and texture (respectively) add a lot, a well a flavor.  I also use the water I soak the mushroom in to reconstitute them a part of the broth.  Super mushroomy.  Served with rotisserie chicken and saute spinach for a nice fall dinner with friends. This be great! I love mushroom risotto and this be a very interest take on it. I especially like the cashews. It turn out creamy and flavorful even without cream or parmesan. I do use tarragon instead of basil, because I didn\\'t have any, but it taste great. Thanks! Very nice.\\r\\nMade without cream. Matt use un-salted cashew & we enjoy their slight crunch in the meal. The first stove-top risotto that have ever work for me (I also highly recommend the delicious and dead-easy oven-baked Spinach Asparagus Risotto you\\'ll find on \\'Zaar). This one be equally fantatistic - a unique combination of flavour with the lemony tang lift it into the sublime. This be amazing! I have never make risotto before but I\\'m glad I pick this a my first recipe. It be so easy, and turn out amazingly creamy even without the add cream.

       " \" Woo, first to review!  This be so easy and quick to put together.  I follow the recipe exactly, except that I do use the 1/4 cup water with the other sauce ingredients.  I prefer boneless chop also, mine be more like an inch thick, but they still cook thorougly in the 20 min oven time.  I brown the chop w/margarine about 6 min each side.  I chop my onion piece a bite large and only have a Vidalia sweet onion.  The sauce be a tiny bite sweet, a little tangy, a tiny bite spicy and go great serve over white rice.  I didn't mind the extra sauciness bring on by the use of that 1/4 cup water, a it thin out the sauce enough to cover the 2 chop and just over 2 cup worth of cook rice at serve time (of course I thicken the sauce w/a bite of cornstarch).  It didn't taste water down though.  The chop be tender, juicy and the sauce have a nice texture and a bite of crunch from the roughly chop onions, and a nice blend of flavors.  Bf think this be pretty good, a well.  Thanks for sharing, shapeweaver! :) I make these twice since tag for the Aussie/NZ RS#37.  The first time I add the 1/4 cup water and the second I leave it out.

If you be look for a crisp cookie, this be not the one :) I think it sound great thank for post it. These cooky be really good and so easy to make.

I mean these be swoon worthy good, like bow down to the chocolate god good! I make them with devil food cake mix with pudding in the cake mix already, also add an extra packet of instant pudding, and the some white chocolate chip I smash up from a leave over candy bar. I cook these in a convenction oven at 335 F for about 10 minutes. Made about 36 HUGE cakey DELICIOUS cookies! These taste good, but didn\\'t quite have the right texture for me. I like these. I think the \"dough\" be absolutely delicious...was soooo hard to mix. I use an electronic mixer and even that have a hard time. I put a little water in it, though, and I be able to mix it more easily. Otherwise, very yummy and easy! This be about a 4 1/2 star for me only for the reason that they\\'re a little overwhelm if you eat more than two... or maybe that\\'s just me!!! I just think they could have use something to sort of break up the cakiness in the cookie like chocolate chip or frosting. Definitely good a a dough! Very good, though. Wow you weren\\'t kid when you say the batter would be stiff! I add a TBS. of oil and that do nothing, add some water-that didn\\'t help either, but didn\\'t wanna add o much and take away from how they be to turn out. I use Dark choc. cake mix and banana cream pudding mix. Cookies taste like and have the texture of banana bread. My kid absolutely LOVE them, and I think they be pretty good too. Next time I will try a diff. combo and add choc. chips! Thanks for the recipe =)',\n",
       " \" This be a great appetizer.  I make it a few night ago when I have family over and it get rave reviews.  It be really easy to prepare.  In term of servings, I would say 4, though three of u devour the whole thing a we wait for dinner to be prepared.  I use a french feta with very little water.  I serve it with bread.  I'll definitely make this again.  Thanks!\",\n",
       " ' Great spice.  The sweet with the spice be good.  I leave out the allspice because I didn\\'t have any.  Great recipe because everything be easily at hand. I like this spice mixture...some heat with a tiny bite of sweet.  I sprinkle it on boneless chicken breast and \"grilled\" them under the broiler.  My husband and I like the kick, but my boy think it be a bite too spicy so use sparingly for wee ones.  I\\'d like to try this same rub mixture on other meats. I use chicken filet and I actually broil mine in the oven also.  It be good, but actually a little bland.  I will make it again and add some salt.',\n",

I\\'m re-rating this a I mark the wrong star box before...It\\'s a GREAT BIG FIVE STAR recipe. This be a great chili! I switch it up quite a bite for what I have at home. I couldn\\'t find tomatillos, so I use crush tomato which mean the chili be no long \"white\". :) Then I use brown rice and no butter or oil and I put everything in the crock pot for 6 hour on high. Even my picky kid eat it, which be sayin\\' somethin\\'! Thanks Julesong. Oh my...this be unbelievably good! I resist the urge to change it up a bite and I be so happy with your recipe exactly a written. My suggestion would be to use navy rather than small white beans, they hold up better. I use can dice mild chili for the whole 1 1/2 C and get pleanty of heat for me. I also use half fresh tomatillo (quartered)  a I have them on hand and if they be available when I make this next time I will use all fresh. I use pork tenderloin but I think a pork shoulder would be the way to go. I also omit the cheese (diet) and serve with lime wedge and chop cilantro. ....thank you! thank you! thank you! ps: it soak up the broth a it sit so buy extra. I didn\\'t have all of the indredients but use enough to get the basic idea and this chile be wonderful.  I do add some dry cranberries, just because I have some.  Tasty and very filling.',\n",
       " \" I prepare this exactly a instructed.  It be definately flavorful, but I relized that the thyme,garlic,and lemon really didn't compliment each other that well. I make this use bone-in chicken - I lift the skin & make small slit in the meat, and insert the garlic.  I also put some of the marinade in the pocket form between the skin & meat.  I then bake it in the oven on 175 degree (on an oven rack).  This be very very yummy, I love lemon (fave citrus), garlic & thyme (fave herb) & think they compliment each other well - I think it's a matter of personal preference to be honest.  Thanks for this very easy way of cook chicken with lot of flavour. I be afraid this be go to be bland, but in fact it be quite tasty. I tend to go overboard, so I do use more garlic and lemon call for. Also, I cook it on a grill pan, which i think really help take it to a new level. The caramelization of the juice and garlic really add an extra depth of flavor.\",\n",
       " \" Easy and very good. ALL  20 people I serve it to love it.  Don't know that I would cut the square before baking.......the fillo separate and the top do not brown at all at 300. zomg this make so much! i quarter the recipe and make little phyllo wrap triangles. make about 20 even with 1/4 the fill describe here. very tasty! discover something odd tho: when make with puff pastry instead of phyllo it change the fill flavor a lot! much mild and le salty, more creamy. worth try anyway I have Greek friend who serve tyropita triangle at party all the time but they get them from an old lady who make them out of her house. I swear this recipe be a closely guarded! I be happy to come across this one because it sound like the real deal. The fill be tasty but the phyllo be not light and crunchy-it be kind of soggy. Next time, I would halve the recipe because the fill be really thick. Or, I would make the more traditional, albeit time-consuming, phyllo triangle so that you get more crunch per bite. I do pre-cut these which be easy than I think however the end result be that the phyllo separate and the cheese kind of ooze out. I might consider up to temp to 325 next time.\",\n",

I make this a write only use fresh Greek oregano.  Definately go into my Favorites of 2012.  Thank you for submitting.  Made for Summer on the Porch Diabetic Forum. This be a fabulous salad, and I\\'m not even wild about tomatoes!  Very refresh and a great barbeque side!  Thanks, Sue! Great salad - I make it up in the late morning pop it in the fridge. I make the dress at the same time but keep it separate a one person do not like dress (imagine!) and serve it on the side  I use  fresh  Greek oregano in the dress and it do have a wonderful flavor. The only thing I add be chop radishes, perhaps not Greek but the garden be overflowing, great add crunch.  Thanks Sue for an easy tasty recipe I absolutely LOVE this salad. I\\'m a huge fan of mediterranean food and this salad be just so juicy, fresh and zesty...I get crave for it! I\\'m not a big onion fan, though, so I reduce the red onion to about 1/4 cup. It still give the salad the flavor that only onion can without be overpowering. Thanks for the great recipe! We love this Greek salad, the dress be outstanding, I use fresh oregano right out of the garden and let the salad marinate  for about 4 hours.  Couldn\\'t find any fat free feta cheese, so use regular cow feta from the deli. Love the kalamata olive with the feta, the taste of the olives, feta and veggie all seem to complement each other and the dress be the perfect finish to bring it all together.  thank for sharing, we\\'ll be do this one again and again. This be very good I love this type of salad, however, I didn\\'t use the olive (I\\'m not a big olive fan).  I do love Balsamic Vinegar so I double it.  Overall this salad have a great flavor and be enjoy very much. Great flavors, the combination be just perfect! I skip the green pepper because I don\\'t like them. My brother and my friend who don\\'t eat salad, finish it all! Thanks Sue! Had a lot of extra tomato to use up so I make this recipe.  Preferred it to regular Greek salad with lettuce.  I also have shred carrot to use up so I throw those in too.  That be also not authentic, but it sure add a lot of vitamin C, color and a touch of sweetness.  I couldn\\'t find low-fat or fat free feta either, so I use some regular feta flavor with Mediterranean herbs.  Ate it that night, and try it the next day after it have marinate a while and it be very good both ways.  Personally, I really like the combination of vinegar myself.  Excellent Greek salad choice.   This be a new favorite salad.  I cut the salt to 1/4 teaspoon and halve the amount of olives, chop them up fairly finely.  I\\'ve serve it fresh and also over several day a it continue to marinate, and it\\'s good all ways.  It keep well for several days.  My favorite treatment be to make the dress separately and mix it in at serve time.  I like to chop the cuke and green pepper in fairly small piece (1/4\") and almost mince the onions. Wonderful salad.  With all the fresh vegetable in my garden, this be just the dish to make to take advantage of them.  The dress be so good!   Very tasty!!  I really like the way the balsamic vinegar enhance the flavor of the dressing.  This be a keeper for sure!  I have make this with a steak the night before and have some leave over; I slice up some of the steak the next day and put it on top of the salad…YUMMO!!!  Thanks for a great recipe!!! This be wonderful!  We grow all of our own produce, so all I have to do be go out back and pick ingredient.  I serve this with the BBQ Korean Pork Loin (on this site)steamed rice and grill veggie from Bobby Flay. I love be the kitchen star in the family, THANKS to ALL the great cook on this website that make me look good! Wow, this salad be incredible.  Easy to make and lot of flavour. There be barely enough leave for lunch today. Next time I won\\'t chop my tomato up a much, but have large slices.  There seem to be a lot of liquid, but the taste be still great.  I make this with lowly \"store bought\" tomatoes.  We eat it with very minimal marinate time--30-40 minutes.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt be still fabulous though we be look forward to eat it \"again\" when the flavor have developed.\\r\\n\\r\\nI make this a a tribute to my step-daughter who recently visit Greek and she say this be very good!\\r\\n\\r\\nCan\\'t wait to make it during the summer with garden produce. We serve this salad to 125 people at a Greek theme church dinner and receive rave reviews!

You make our live much easy that night! Thanks for sharing!! This be the perfect marriage of ingredients.  What a great salad.  I use dry oregano (1 tsp) because I do not have fresh.  It be delicious! A new family favorite.  Thanks!  I love this salad!  I do add a can of chickpea to mine, along with some mint.  It make a very refresh side dish.  My mother add tuna to hers and make it into an entree, but I personally do not like it like that.  Try this recipe!!! This salad be to die for.  We absolutely love everything low fat and especially feta cheese.  We use our own home grow tomato and it such a low cal meal that the two of u gobble up the entire salad.  We also have garlic toast slice that taste great dip into the tomato sauce leave over.  You have to try this one for sure. Great!  I add 2 clove of mince garlic and fresh grind black pepper.

I be so lucky to come across this recipe. \\r\\nBravo, Sue L.\\r\\n This be a wonderful salad, make for a tailgate last weekend and be a hit. If you love greek salad, you will love this. Delicious feta and kalamata olive really make it special! I make a version of this that I just LOVE. It be basically the same a Sue L\\'s, but I add some red and yellow peppers, artichoke hearts, and finely chop pepperoncini\\'s. I also use herbes de provence (rosemary, marjoram, thyme, and savory) It be such an easy, refreshing, flavorful salad..it just make me happy! Delicious!!  I make this for my son\\'s high school graduation party last night and everybody love it.  I want some make ahead salad to serve along with grill chicken and steak, so I make this one, the Artichoke and Garbanzo Salad and the Garlicky Cilantro Roasted Potato Salad.  Rave review on all. I add some pepperocini like some others mention and slice the olives.  I make it the day before and be afraid it might be too soggy the next day, so after put it all together,  I drain off the dress and save it, then add most of it right before serving.  It be perfect!! Wow! This salad get rave review at my last dinner party with folk clamor for take-home portion & one person call the next day for the recipe! We make this quite frequently now & it taste great & be nutritionally beneficial. Keeps in the frig for several days. Thanks. This be great!  I love the flavor and textures.  I\\'ve never have Kalamata olive before, but I really enjoy them.  Thanks for broaden my food horizons.  Great recipe! This be the very first recipe we have try from recipezaar. Have make greek salad more time than i can recall but never taste this good. Dressing fantastic, perfect ratio of sweet and sharpness. Will be make this again thank you Sue L. I love this...I do omit the red onion (a bite too strong for us) and cucumber.  So I add celery.  Black bean might also be a nice addition. Thanks This be great! I make it for a party and the everyone(About 20 people)really like it. I double this recipe and it work great. I have to drain some liquid off a it be chilling, because the tomato I have be pretty darn ripe. I also add black bean and some mince garlic. Super good stuff. We love this.  Simple to put together and a real crowd pleaser. I make to go with a Greek dish I be making.  Really good!  Thank you Sue!  Cindy We branch out and try a few new recipe for Easter. This be one. We all love it. Even though my 8 yr old request to substitute the olive with just plain black olives, she love it too!  I be impress that if preserve well for a few days! Thanks, We will use this with our fresh tomato out of the garden this Summer. So glad I make this tonight!  It be a huge hit with my family.  I use black olive and double the olive oil...excellent! This be well receive at our family get together.  I especially like that it be a no lettuce salad.  I love lettuce, but when I make a salad to take to a function, it always seem to get soggy.  Because tomato shouldn\\'t be refrigerated, I make up the whole salad minus the tomato and let sit in fridge for a few hours.  When I be ready to serve, I cut the tomato up into large wedge and mix up another serve of marinade and dress the salad again. Delicious. Made to go with Recipe #17962, and serve to company.  Everyone love this salad and it be all go at the end of the meal.  I use Roma tomato a they be nice and firm.  Worked great! this be a good salad! very greek without the lettuce in there! i actually be make souvlaki on the grill so i throw on some french bread brush with olive oil and ur salad end become brushetta! i tottttally recommend u try this salad on top of toasty bread! it be SO good! :D! make for zwt4 This be my favorite salad ever! I use black and kalamata olives, red and green pepper all those flavor be almost too much too take they be so delish! Don\\'t forget the fresh grind pepper! Excellent the next day in a pita with rotisseri chicken! XOXO Delicious! Thank you for sharing. These be delicious and this be how we usually make our salads. We simply love the blend of flavor of these fresh tomatoes, cucumbers, pepper and olives. Feta in a greek salad always make it taste good and the addition of red wine vinegar here which be new to u make it all the more great! Thanks!Made for WZT4. This be easy and very good. Great with all the fresh summer flavors. The only thing i might do different next time be leave the veggie in big chunks. The over all taste be great. I do sub fresh basil for the oregano, it\\'s what i have on hand. \\r\\nThanks for the post. This be really tasty salad and exactly what I crave in a greek salad. Confession- I hate tomato (I know, right?) so I make this with four cucumber instead of tomatoes. It be really good. I also salt the cucumbers, set them aside for a half hour, and then drain them to remove excess moisture. I know it\\'s not a good a fresh, but dry oregano do work just fine in this recipe if it\\'s all that\\'s on hand. Thanks for the recipe! Yummy! I make with cherry tomato from the garden and love the balsamic and wine vinegar mix together. I use my Recipe #320389 instead of real feta cheese. Thanks Sue! Made for the Zaar Stars game. Although this be very similar to the Greek salad I have be making, this will be the one I make from now on.  For our tastes, it have the perfect balance of ingredient and dress (which be delicious, and couldn\\'t be easy to make). This be fabulous. I use organic produce and Cuban oregano. It be a hit at our office potluck. I also find whole feta that I cub rather than the crumbles. People be really receptive to the chunk of cheese. Thanks for sharing! I didn\\'t have any red wine vinegar, but I have everything else. It still turn out great. It\\'s even good the next day. Thanks so much for post this recipe. I just love this salad. I could eat it every single day. Thank you for share the recipe. Great salad! Very light and refreshing. It\\'s also easy on the diet.\\nI be go to serve it on a bed of salad green to fill me up more! This be only 6 point on Weight Watchers and just a little different. Thanks,\\nCarole in Orlando Amazing! The marinate give this such a depth of flavour. Thank you for sharing. :) One thing that attract me to this recipe be that be be low in the oil and that it have so many positive hits...but, I wish I have read the comment first before I make this up!  I leave out the green bell pepper a I can\\'t eat them and add more tomatoes.  I felt that, a it was, this salad be lack in something.  I add 1 large garlic, chop and some salt and freshly grind pepper.  I don\\'t think I care for the red wine vinegar...I would have use all balsamic vinegar.   After go back and read the comments, most people do doctor the salad with garlic and pepper.  IF I be to make this one again, I would have cut down on the tomato and add a can of black bean and maybe more garlic.  This be a good basic recipe, but it do need to be play around with! This be a very good salad recipe.  I have some small cherry tomato I be want to use up and this be the recipe I chose.  We really like it.  I add a few more olive then call for but otherwise follow the recipe exactly.  thank you for share this recipe with us. Great flavor! Had some Greek Dressing so use 3 tbsp of that instead of the vinegar and oil! \\nWill try to thinly slice since the dice size be hard to eat with a fork! I have make this recipe several times. Everyone love it. Before I serve it I usually add more of the dress which I think be a delicious combination of flavors. For something different sometimes I use this for the base of a pasta salad by just add pasta to it and additional dressing. It be really delicious this way a well. Outrageous salad!  I make this exactly a posted, except I use some grape tomatoes.  Really flavorful.  I could eat the whole thing by myself!  Will make often. Delightful! Used orange instead of green bell peppers. Made this a a summer side dish, great flavor and color.  I use a red pepper a I prefer them to green, otherwise follow recipe exactly.  YUM!  I be able to marinade about 2 hour in the fridge before dinner, everyone think it taste great.<br/>UPDATE: Since last year this have become my go-to salad that be requested. I frequently add a half a box of farfalle mini bow tie pasta and double the sauce and feta - I get compliment all the time on this fresh summery pasta salad. Very good! I use just half of the vinegar amounts, due to hubby\\'s preference. Otherwise, make a is. I be Greek and I must say that we do not eat such a salad in Greece, neither be serve in restaurants, which serve traditional Greek food. I have the follow remarks:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;1) If you preserve tomato in the fridge after cut them they will lose their scent. Tomato should be serve fresh.&lt;br/&gt;2) The same happen with oregano, which should be pour on top of the salad fresh.&lt;br/&gt;3) Balsamic vinegar have nothing to do with Greeks and greek tomato salad.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The only Greek Salad I know that be marinate and preserve in the fridge, be the &quot;Politiki Salata&quot;, Salad from Constantinopolis, widely serve in north Greece and Thessaloniki. You can find this recipe in this link: http://www.greek-recipe.com/salad-from-constantinopolis/&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do not doubt that this could be a nice salad, although I express my concern especially about preserve cut tomato in the fridge but definitely be not a Greek Salad.',\n",

This be extremely flavorful and easy to make!  Thank you :) This be very easy to do and have excellent taste.  I use catfish fillets.  Beautiful and yummy.  Made for ZWT 4. Wow, do this pack flavor!

This be really simple and very tasty but I think it just over power our Spangled Emperor (in the snapper family) fillet a bit. I would be incline to halve the mustard powder and omit the cayenne for our tastes. We also use low fat margarine like Sarah Jayne. I'll just leave comment a I didn't broil the fish! I make 1/2 marinade recipe for a 220 g salmon fillet; marinate for 20 minutes, bake in the oven, 20 minute at 200 C. (How be that for a constellation of 2's? :-) ) Turned out delicious!! Not super-spicy at all, just very flavourful and lovely. Will definitely make again - thank you for the recipe! Yummy!  Easy, fast, healthy and delicious.  LOVE IT!  I follow the recipe except for the water.  I just add lemon juice to make the paste.  I do not add a much butter.  I use Reynolds non-stick aluminum foil and no butter.  I do put about 1 teaspoon of butter on top of the fish before put into the broiler.  The kid think it be too spicy but we love it.  I will make this again.  Thank you. We really enjoy this Indian spice fish recipe.  It be easy to prepare and pack a lot of flavor.  I use swordfish and halve the recipe to suit 1 lb of fish, which work fine.

This year we be a tad short on both the cranberry and the persimmons, so we dice up some apple to bulk up the filling. Very good pie.

I keep plan to use them in apple recipe or create my own but haven't get around to it. For this pie, I use refrigerate pie crusts, 3/4 cup sugar, fresh grind nutmeg and a dash of cloves. I add the sugar to the fruit in step 2. I bring it to Thanksgiving and everyone enjoy it. They comment that the flavor remind them of strawberries.

I be not sure whether I should cook this or not, since I have never hear of eat oatmeal uncooked. I do taste it raw, but the texture and my intuition tell me I should cook it before eat it. Since this be a contest entry, I could not ask the chef their intentions. It do stick a lot to the pot while cooking, and be very thick by that point, so I add more milk to it once it be done.

I might even try use evaporate milk to make it even thick and creamier. I end up add quite a bite of extra sugar; and, when it seem it just couldn't get enough flavor for me, I start add chocolate syrup to it, and that helped.

Perfect dough to work with, lovely little different buns, great for egg breakfast sandwiches, I think! EDIT: I order oat fiber and make these again immediately. We all PREFER the original recipe, include my 6 and 4 year olds. who be not at all picky but very selective. I will probably be the only one to eat the oat one so that they be not wasted. My daughter request these for her lunch box sandwich everyday now! We will keep this recipe (the original post) and repeat many times.....thanks again! These be awesome!! Easy enough for my grandson to make and so good! I make cinnamon roll with this recipe also and they be delicious! My husband really like these! I will not buy them anymore! Thank you so much. I do make a few changes. I add two egg white for each egg and I use stevia in the raw instead of sugar. I grind up all bran cereal for the wheat germ.. thank you so much for post this! I be go to try make loaf of bread with this recipe too!\",\n",

Very nice oil & vinegar side dish/salad! Fresh and light. We be look for a recipe to use today's bean and cherry tomato harvest from the garden. Didn't have shallot on hand, so we use mince yellow onion. It be fine. Made very good next day left-overs, serve cold. Cooking Light be a great resource--almost always love their recipes.

       " ' i give these out last year on halloween to friend and people be beg for them this year!  i do use the cardamom and i think that be a good choice. These have be an absolute hit with everyone every time I have make them.  They be incredibly easy to make and just heavenly! I like these, but they weren\\'t a spicy a I want them to be. Next time I would add some ginger. My husband, however, say \"mmmm, ooohh, yum!\". He love them. I use pecans, a that\\'s what I have on hand. Wonderful!!! My husband have be crave a cookie like this since he sample one at a bakery. They hit the spot! I do not change anything, I do use the spice substitute suggested.  Thank you for the awesome recipe! Yummy!  I make these without the macadamia nuts, and use the nutmeg and ginger suggest instead of cardamom. I make these without the nut because I didn\\'t have any.  I do however have the cardomom and I think it add a wonderful delicate flavor to the cookies.  A little more interest than the usual spice use with pumpkin.  Overall, I think the flavor combination work beautifully together. Theses cooky be great and easy. If I make tem again I would reduce the butter by 1/3 and reduce the chip by 1/3. Yummmm, we love these cookies! It be one of our favorite to eat all year round. It\\'s the same recipe I have, except there be no cardamom in the ingredients. ( I will have to try that spice!) I believe I get my recipe off of Libby\\'s pumpkin. These cooky have great flavor and texture. Can\\'t go wrong with this cookie. ooooh my gosh! These be soooo good.  Family love love these too! If you like pumpkin pie, you\\'ll love this. It almost taste like a pumpkin pie in a cookie to me. They come out crunchy on the outside and very soft on the inside. I make this recipe a write with the cardamom.  It add an exotic and good taste to the cooky that I think you should try.  They disappear from this house!  It\\'s a soft cookie.  The crunchy outside be go after the first day so eat them fast. Loved this cookie, it a keeper! Very good cooky - moist and chewy.  Great texture w/ the nut and chips.<br/>The only thing that I think be miss from this recipe be salt.  I don\\'t use salt butter when I bake, but I think the recipe need salt butter or a teaspoon of salt. These be delicious!!!  I will add more spice next time, but they be a hit! The recipe come from an old Hershey&#039;s Cookies and Bars recipe book that I still have. I have make these so many time and they be out of this world! I use Pumpkin Spice instead and sometimes I use Walnuts and they be just a good. This cookie be like eat a piece of candy! It&#039;s a holiday favorite!',\n",

I be skeptical that it would fill up a 13x9 inch pan, but it be perfect. Thanks for this recipe-its a keeper! I make with fresh yellow and golden squash, and zucchini, and it turn out great!

       " \" This be the best strawberry pie I've ever eaten.  Simply delicious! The strawberry be ripe and this be the perfect recipe to use some of them! The cream cheese layer in the crust really add a nice flavor. Then, pour the fill over the fresh berry give you a mix between a cook fill and a fresh filling. This be an excellent recipe! I will make this one often, I have a lot of strawberry lovers! Thank you Bev!! We really love strawberries, and this pie be a very good way to fix them. Loved it!! I have two bucket of fresh strawberry and this recipe sound so good.  I make two pies, one for my family and one for the neighbors.  It be fast, easy and very delicious.  I will definitely keep this recipe and make again!! I do change one thing, I use a graham cracker crust. I love the cream cheese bottom, really add to the great taste of strawberries. Oh Bev this be a keeper!    I be lazy and use a store buy gram cracker crust.   \\r\\nVERY GOOD! This be an excellent strawberry pie recipe. Very easy to make too. I add some powder sugar to the cream cheese. The strawberry top be perfectly berry sweet. This look dazzle and you should have see everyone gobble it down. Thanks Bev :) I make this for a family gathering, and it get rave reviews.  \\r\\nAlthough I make the glaze precisely accord to the recipe, it be thin than I would have like it to be.  I will probably add a bite more cornstarch next time.  Since the pie go over so well, there will be a next time - it's definitely a recipe worth the effort of adjusting. I'm sorry, I follow the recipe exactly and I could not get this pie to turn out. Perhaps I use too many fresh strawberry in the pie crust because when I add the cook strawberry mixture, it just ooze over the top and spill out. It never do set up properly in the refrigerator. My dad really like this pie, but a for myself and the other taste testers, we prefer a different strawberry recipe; so a a result, I probably won't be make this again. Wow! Just make this today with fresh pick strawberries.  I also add just a bite of ice sugar to the cream cheese mixture. My cook mixture set perfectly- perhaps anyone have a problem wasn't let it boil long enough because I follow the recipe exactly and it set like a charm.  Next time I may try a graham cracker crust.  This be far superior to anything make with Jello( not a product I use).  It get the thumb up from the sweet tooth in my family.  Oops! I forget to review this recipe! Boy, be this an awesome strawberry pie! I absolutely LOVE the cream cheese layer. I take it to a birthday potluck and everyone say it be sooo good! Great stuff! Thanx for such a wonderful recipe! LOVE IT!  I like to use an oreo cookie crust with this pie.  It be SINFULLY good, and worth the effort every time. Unfortunately, this be not the strawberry pie recipe I be look for.  I want one without jello, and this fitst the bill there.  But, there be not enough cream cheese to make a difference for me.  I would potentially leave the cream cheese out next time and just try it a a normal strawberry pie.  The cook top be easy and good, I would use that again. Good gosh this pie be awesome!!!  It be just about inhale by my guest at my dinner party!!!  I have a good mind to make it again for Thanksgiving, but I don't think the strawberry will be real good by then.  I will have to wait and see, but you can bet your bottom dollar I will be make it again and again. Delicious! Deeeeelicious!!!  I have strawberry to use up and find this recipe (it sound much good than a jello pie); I be so glad I try it!  I add a couple pinch of granulate sugar to the cream cheese and it be just right.  I highly recommend this pie. Wanted to make a strawberry pie without Jello for my family (I'm allergic, so none for me). We be try to decide between strawberry pie & strawberry cheesecake. With the inclusion of cream cheese in this recipe, it please everyone. My 5 year old who love cheesecake & pie have two pieces! No problem with the fill set up at all, which btw smell divine.  Thanks! SO much good than a strawberry pie use the commercial glaze which I think can be overly sweet.  The cream cheese layer be a great addition.  I will make this often!! This be an excellent and easy recipe.  I use lemon extract in the cream cheese, which give it even more of a lemony bite.  Everyone really enjoy it and want the recipe.  Like many others, I do not feel the food color be necessary.  I will definitely make this again! Delicious pie!  I love that it call for some mash berry in the sauce and NOT strawberry gelatin like some recipes.  It seem far more honest and flavorful.  I do not use the food color - it didn&#039;t need it. I&#039;m glad I make a regular pastry crust - I think a graham cracker crust might have be too sweet.  The lemon zest in the unsweetened cream cheese be GENIUS!!  What a zing of contrast flavor without more sweetness.  Love this.  Thanks!\",\n",

Wonderful!!  We do this for first barbeque of the year and cousin's birthday.  Shrimp be her favorite.\\r\\n\\r\\nYour recipe look the best and I do make a few changes.  No rice wine vinegar so I use white balsamic.  Marinated for 30 minutes, I hear that after that the seafood start 'cooking' in the lime/vinegar.  Subsituted 2 inch cub of halibut steak for half the shrimp.  Used fresh pineapple instead of mango.  Skewered all item separately for easy grill timing.  I boil the marinade and mix that with brown jasmine rice per first comment.  Absolutely DEEElicious.  The halibut and pineapple be incredible.  I never imagine do green onion like that, but will from now on.  I be eager to try it with mango.  Thanks for the great recipe!  this be an excellent shrimp recipe.  Marinated for about an hour, and baste 3 time during grilling. I use one red bell, and one yellow bell pepper, which add to the great color too!\\r\\n(I put aside a couple of tblspns of the marinade b4 marinate and drizzelled a little on top of the cook skewer and rice).Served with basmati. mmm this be yummy This be a lovely kabob recipe that be thoroughly enjoy by myself and 8 year old son, my 10 year old isn't a fan of pepper or onion so I only put the mango on his and he wouldn't even eat the mango *rolling eyes*.

Very tasty steak, marinate in red wine. The sauce be quite outstanding, and one of those 2 ingredient wonders... well, three, to be exact.

We make over 20 of these everyone come out nice and moist love it everybody love it it&#039;s a keeper!!! For sure Awesome recipe! The whole family love it. I make a confectioner glaze for the top �� Delish and moist! The only tweak I make be that I add an orange instead of orange juice.

My South Philadelphia dad (RIP) be one of those &quot;make-weekend-breakfast&quot; cooks, with backyard grill throw in. But when I move out, he try new things. This be one of his specialities. I still have his hand-written, batter-stained recipe—which friend and family have request copy of over the years—and the recipe on this site be the same one he used. A dense, delicious, true &quot;comfort food&quot; cake. I haven’t make this cake since the 90’s. I can’t believe it’s the same one that my friend give me back then. I’m originally from South Philadelphia so that’s probably where she saw it in the the recipe section of the city’s newspaper. I now live in Massachusetts and have an over abundance of apple and when I google an apple cake recipe, this one pop up. Will definitely make this cake soon. Was look for an interest Jewish Apple Cake. This sound good, so I give it a try. Turned out GREAT! Moist, dense, very apple-ey and delicious. Tried it in one of my Bundt pan and it come out beautiful. Will definitely be make this one again! Only issue... take WAY long to bake than the state time. Maybe because I use a Bundt pan? Seems like it should have be about the same cook time a a tube pan/Angel food cake pan? My mom make this often .. But never add any nut ..?? I love nut so I'm go to give it a try This cake be just delicious but I have a few tweak from the recipe I be give by a friend that might help out a few of you. My bake time call for 1 3/4 hour not 1 1/4 use same amount of flour/eggs/oil. Also, my recipe call for 3 tsp bake powder which might help too. I reduce amount of sugar toss with apple to 5 tablespoon and make up for it in the batter by add 2 cups, not 1 1/2. And, end with layer of apples- on top. Has anyone ever try this with a rum sause? Question: When measure flour, what be the proper way? Do you spoon the flour into the measure cup or scoop the flour from the bag with the measure cup?\",\n",

I find the extra butter in the pan actually make it hard to flip them, the butter in the batter be all it needs. The dry pan make them more manageable\\r\\n\\r\\nTip2..forget putty knives.After try a few thing discover the easy way be to first make sure the crepe be thin..wait until it brown on the bottom and when brown enough use a silicone spatula to lift it up and turn it. The first couple of try you will likely end up with a mess but soon a it become clear that when it ready for turn you can move it easily in one piece around the pan, there will be no more messes.\\r\\n\\r\\nTip 3.

Not only do they taste fabulous, I feel much good about eat them since they\\'re actually good for you. Thanks so so much! I be about to start type \"these be dangerously good,\" but what\\'s dangerous? The walnut be full of Omega-3 fatty acids. The cocoa powder be full of antioxidants. And the date be pack with fiber and potassium. They be super delicious - just like brownie batter! Thank you so much for posting! I can\\'t wait to try the variations. These be great when you need a treat. I make these exactly a written. I give these to my teenager and even they like them. They be easy to make too. Thanks for the recipe. Yummy, these taste soooooo amazing.  Have be \"Eating Clean\" and want a little treat these fit the bill perfectly!  Thanks for a delicious treat. Although this recipe itself be great, I\\'m even more excite about the variation possibility for make snack a la Larabar. I\\'ve only ever have one or two of them before, but think at each time that it should be possible to make something so simple at home. I also think the ball/small bite format be good than a bar of something. I\\'m surprise they haven\\'t come out with Larabites, actually. So I make these with almond because they\\'re what I have around, use only 1 cup of date (all I had, and I like chocolate le sweet), and 4 T cocoa. I think a slightly high date to nut ratio be need than the 1:1 that I end up with, but I be still able to get these to stick together in balls, although at first I think I\\'d have to add some liquid. I be look forward to try dates/ cherries/ pecan and maybe dates/ apples/ raisins/ cinnamon/ pecan and all kind of others. Thanks! Extremely delicious and totally addictive--my DH and I fell madly in love with these little \"babies\"!!  I make a quarter of the original servings, and get 4 truffle-size Fudge Babies; 2 for each of us.  Plus, I use pecans, carob powder (1 Tbsp), and a tiny drizzle of raw honey (the date I use be a bite dry)--and all of that work great.  These would be perfect for the holidays...but who can wait until then?!  :)  Thanks so much for posting, Boomette!! Very fudgy! I make use medjool date so my mixture be a little dry than if I have use package date with sugar added. But easily fix by add 2 teaspoon water. I use pecan and 4 T cocoa powder. The mixture smell like brownies....yum! A nice healthy alternative. I make about 2 dozen ball (approx. 3/4-inch diameter). Made for Every Day be a Holiday tag. Delicious! I add some cardamom and freeze orange juice concentrate (for flavouring) and use Brazil nut instead of walnuts; I also didn\\'t bother measure the ingredient, just eyeball it, and they turn out great - though a little too sweet to my liking. Thanks for the recipe!!! Absolutely wonderful, at least the 1st version be ~ I figure I couldn\\'t go wrong with a combo like nut & date & chocolate! They definitely make for a great chocolate fix, & these \"babies\" will be make more than once again in my kitchen before the end of the year, & I look forward to add some of them to my holiday gift bags! Thanks for post the recipe! [Made & review in Zaar Stars tag] These be great. Very healthy and delicious. I make them with half a cup of walnut and half a cup of almond meal, 2 cup of date and 2 table spoon of cocoa powder.',\n",

       " ' My whole family love it.  The dough be very sticky, though, and take forever to cook through to the middle.  I think next time I\\'ll cut back a little on the liquid and see if it bake better. Delicious flavor and texture.  Toasts beautifully. Great bread. I do alter it a bite (halved the recipe, use half whole wheat and half white flour, use honey instead of maple syrup, use shorten instead of butter, use a whole egg instead of a half and cut down a little on the shorten to even out the fat content).Ok, I change it a lot. I also use instant yeast which really cut down on the time - after knead it I let it rest for about 10 minutes, flatten it out into a roughly 6x12x1 rectangle, roll it up, and let it rise in a grease loaf pan for about 1.5 hour and put it in the oven. I get it out when the internal temp. hit 205-210. The bread be beautiful and absolutely delicious. I be look for a way to use up leftover oatmeal from breakfast AND....This be delish!!! And super easy!  I follow the recipe exactly - and interestingly, unlike another reviewer - mine cook up in about 30 minute - any long and it would have be over do and hard on the outside.  This have a very nice crumb to it - slice easily (you could slice it thin if you need to) - didn\\'t fall apart when you smear anything on it and my family of 5 love it!  Next time I\\'ll sub 1/2 whole wheat flour - and use honey instead of maple syrup...EDIT on 8/19/09: I have make this many, many time - each time it be DEVOURED.  I want to add that this dough be really, really soft.  Not kneadable at all - I end up glopping it into the pan and smooth the top.  which actually make this the easy bread to make if you have a good stand mixer/dough hook.  :) Very delicious, very nice texture. It\\'s very soft, but plenty sturdy for sandwich or whatever. The texture be nice and bready, not cakey, and the buttermilk add a nice tang, almost like sourdough. I\\'m go to make this all the time, and also try to spread the word, because this bread deserve more than 4 ratings! This be good bread, but with the amount of ingredient given, it be essentially a batter bread. There be nothing wrong with batter breads, but the word \"knead\" should not appear in the directions. As other reviewer have found, the dough be much too sticky to do anything like kneading. As one other reviewer found, I, also, have have trouble judge when a batter bread be cook through. So, I add enough flour (close to 2 cups) to get a still sticky, but kneadable dough. I use 1 tablespoon regular, not kosher, salt, and be now regret that I didn\\'t increase it by about 1/2 teaspoon. Other than that, the bread be very good. Thank you for share this recipe with us. I be make this bread for the 3rd time this morning. I love that be use cook oatmeal. I add a couple of tablespoon of millet to the mix when cook the oatmeal. Adds a bite of crunch. Also 1/2 white and 1/2 whole wheat. This be a great bread, with a nice dense crumb that hold up well. I make it in the artisan bread method. I mix it up and instead of kneading, I let it sit for a day or two in the fridge to &quot;sour&quot;. I use 1/2 the recipe at a time and it fill my pullman loaf pan perfectly. I also like to bake half the loaf and have small size rounds. I slice and toast them crispy for crackers. Spread with hummus or avocado or bean dip or....just dip in oil and herbs. VEry nice. Also a great bread for grill cheese sandwiches.',\n",

Well, after eat he said-  \" you\\'ve even make Lima bean taste good  ;)  I didn\\'t mention to him what a super-food kale be or how much protein be in the bean  <br/> I recommend blanch the kale- well worth the time. Do soak your own legume overnight and use freshly cook beans- can bean be no match in flavor and texture IMO.  I use large Limas but have baby Limas in the cupboard for the next time since I prefer a small bean.  This dish be fine enough for the holiday table a a side dish to a hearty roast beef or a a meatless casserole style main dish anytime.  <br/>The taste be wonderful - kale be flavorful, soften and not bitter, the tomato taste be not overwhelming, and Limas work very well with it all (even use the large one they be indeed very velvety and creamy), it have a very \\'rich\\' taste and flavor for a bean dish and it all blend well once you take a bite.Though I didn\\'t seem to get too much caramelize a much a a sauce- maybe take the lid off of  the casserole dish for a little long might have do the trick. Leftovers taste even a bite better,as always - so cook them in the \"Do Ahead\" way might also be better. <br/><br/> Though I do not have the Herbs de Provence, I use what I had.

       " \" I make this to serve with chili.  I use the regular light crust cycle rather than the rapid cycle, because I don't trust the rapid cycle on my machine.  I don't put it in a bag, because that steam the bread and make it wet and mushy.  Instead, I brush the crust with a little melt butter.   In spite of these deviations, this be a very good bread recipe.  It be nothing like a traditional cornbread, but rather a light wheat bread flavor with cornmeal.  I would very definitely make this again.  Made for Bargain Basement Tag. If you want to make a hearty, tasty homemade bread for a dinner party the same day, this recipe will work well!  However, if you're a slow to eat a loaf of bread a my family, the cornmeal will show it disadvantage a soon a the bread isn't fresh: it suck the moisture out of the bread and make it go stale fast than the basic ABM bread recipe.

I have a very small tenderloin end, about 13 oz, and figure it might dry out so I say  to heck with healthy and wrap a couple strip of bacon around it. I also have some very very small new potato so I precook them 4 min in the microwave, pile them around the loin in one of those foil pie tins. {Durn but those be handy}. Paint/drizzled the glaze over it all and let to get to 154 with my handy dandy polder {HEH, I be use one B4 I even hear of Alton}.\\r\\nAnyhow,,,, Finest Kind!!!!!! This get my abosulute high for taste.  I\\'d give it more than 5 star if I could. It be absolutely fabulous!!!! I think the marinade have a great flavor, I serve with fry rice and my husband love it. Thanks for a simple and elegant recipe. Was very moist and tender but I think it have very little flavor from the marinade.  The foil underneath the meat be an absolute must. Easy and quick to make.  I like the flavour of the marinade, but find there wasn\\'t enough of it (even though i\\'d make it with pretty generous \"teaspoons\"). Maybe if you rub the pork with it and seal it in a ziploc bag overnight, the flavour would penetrate the meat better? I have since use it a a baste on bbq\\'d pork chop (tripled the quantity and skip the sesame seeds) and it be very good, such a nice combination of flavours. Very Yummy!! I didn\\'t have molasses, so just add some extra honey.  I do marinate the pork in an extra help of the honey/soy sauce mixture for a few hour ahead of time, make some small fork hole in the meat. Delicious!  Definitely add lot of foil to your pan for an easy clean-up!   This be fantastic!  I triple the honey mixture and marinate the tenderloin for 2 hour b4 cooking.  My DH, who hat ginger eat it right up and go back for seconds!  This be my Easter pork from now on, no more hams!  Thanks Erin Excellent. As recommend by others I do triple the honey and double the sauce, I too forget to pre-check the pantry for molasses, and shock to find I didn\\'t have any. Marinated for 24 hrs. in a Zip-lock bag. The cook time be PERFECT!\\r\\nThank You so much Erin Rogers! Absolutely fantastic! I follow the recipe exactly, except use bottle mince ginger which be a huge timesaver. Very moist, great flavor, and one which the entire family loved. Bake time be perfect, but DO NOT skip the foil line pan. We\\'ll have this one again. Thanks, Erin, for posting! I marinate the meat for 24 hour and then I take it out of the marinade and put it on foil and put it in the preheat oven.  It have a nice flavor but one of my son want a sauce.  Was I suppose to cook it in the marinade?  Can you do it either way?  I use the syrup from can cling peach and serve the peach with it too.  I like it a lot!  Thanks for posting! I make a direct and have wonderful result : )  The sauce be so good I will definitely double it next time because everyone want more!  The pork be very tender and perfectly flavored!  Thank you for share your recipe! Very nice.  Did 2 tenderloin at once, 45 min @ 425 and they be a tad over do (about 190 degrees).  I\\'ll check a litte early next time.  Tripled the sauce recipe, an be still a little short.  Family enjoy it, so will make again.  Thanks for sharing. Excellent recipe!\\r\\nI cut the tenderloin into 1\" rounds, marinate 5 hrs. then bake for 30 mins, turn them over and cook 10 min more.\\r\\nI use Reynolds Release Foil for no stick and an easy clean-up.\\r\\nThe meat turn out tender and moist, this be a quick and delicious dinner.  I serve it with jasmine rice. I marinate this a month ago during one of my cook sessions.  Froze it with all of the ingredients.  It be one of the best tenderloin recipe I have ever had.  It be so tender, and very juicy.  I agree that it be wise to line your pan before cooking, because the marinade be so sticky once cooked.  Thanks for sharing! We really love it. I make this with family here, it taste wonderful, I have a hard time find a recipe that would be tasty for pork tenderloin and wouldn\\'t be too salty. Everyone love it, I only wish I have marinate it longer. I love this dish.  It look like a lot of ingredient but it actually be a really quick dish to make.  I didn\\'t want to buy fresh gingerroot so I buy the dry version and use 1/4 tsp and 1/4 tsp powder garlic and it come out great.  It\\'s simple but very tasty.     Great recipe! pretty good! I overcook it though since it come out a bite dry. I didn\\'t use molasses, just honey and I think it work just fine.  Thanks! Enjoyable and easy to make. Very tasty!  This pork be moist and tender, and quite flavorful consider how healthy it is.  Will make again! I also triple the marinade ingredients, line my pan with foil, and I pour the marinade over the pork before I bake it. My family love this. It be a keeper.  UPDATE: I double the sauce and marinate the pork for 45 minutes.  It be very good. Even my dbf who isn\\'t a pork fan love this recipe!! LOL! Loved the mix of soy sauce and sesame oil - do double the marinade ingredient and leave the meat in the marinade for a couple of hours. Thanks erin! :) This sauce be amazing!  The only thing I change be swap the fresh ginger for dry (I\\'m allergic to fresh!).  I also use pork chop instead of a tenderloin. The sauce remind me of the teriyaki wing from a certain famous restaurant..... This be excellent!  I make the recipe a stated, except I double the honey to sub for molasses, and I use quite a bite more sesame seed that call for.  This be excellent with some roast asparagus and couscous.  Thanks! This be a delicious way to prepare pork tenderloin. My only change be to leave out the ginger a I don\\'t like the flavor, I marinate the loin for a little while before baking, plus I only bake it to between 135-140 degree which take approx. 25 minute on the convection setting. 45 minute and 160 degree would create an overcook dry tenderloin in my book. I let it sit uncover for 10 minute before serving, then slice. Great recipe! What a terrific recipe; hubby rave about how delicious it was, and especially how tender it come out give that pork tenderloin can easily be tough.  The only substitution that we make be maple syrup for the honey, since we make our own.  As we say in Maine, \"Some good!\"',\n",

Thank you for this recipe to be use for year to come! :) This cake be so yummy! I add big chunk of chop Granny Smith apple before the top then add toast pecan on top after swirl the topping.

       " \" This be so easy and so very good. I make it a write and leave out the raisins. Thanks for posting. Super easy and also super yummy! I halve the recipe, and use part of a resealable jar of Lucky Leaf premium pie filling. I put raisin on half, but leave them off half because I don't like them. I also have some caramel apple dip leave over from Recipe#192616, so I drizzle it across the top a soon a I take it out of the oven, then sprinkle with powder sugar after the 30 minute cool time. DELICIOUS! I think it would be wonderful to mix some of the caramel apple dip in the fill a well before baking. This have to be the easy dessert I have ever made, and the taste be good than any apple pie I've ever had. It would be good with a powder sugar glaze on top a well. I would gladly serve it to company a well! I will gladly make it again, exactly a written, and with the caramel addition. Thanks so much post such a wonderful recipe Kitten! This be such a great, quick recipe!! I need a dessert super quickly over the weekend and this be just perfect. I love traditional strudel too, but just do not have the time to make one. This be a great alternative. I do love puff pastry sheets; they be so versatile!!\",\n",

       " ' Really yummy ! I didn\\'t have \"cinnamon sugar\" in my cupboard so I make my own of equal part of each. This really be like an extra special cobbler; if I wouldn\\'t have bake it myself, I wouldn\\'t have know that there be cheese in it. The cheesecake portion and the peach simply become one delicious layer sandwich between the crusty bottom and the crumbly topping. Wonderful- thank for post ! This be again in Penzey\\'s spice catalog and I think how wonderful with fresh peach be in season.  I make cinnamon sugar by use <a href=\"/41463\">Cinnamon Sugar</a>.  I use the 2 cup of fresh peach and next time will add a touch more peaches.  There be a delicate shorthbread crust with the creamy cheesecake and peach in between.  I cut these into 24 square and will take a large number to work today.  Thanks for posting. I make 2 pan of these.  One be eat right away and the other be in the freezer.  I will take it out her soon and see how it did.  I will update review when I do that. I didn\\'t care for this recipe for a few reasons.  First, the ingredient list call for 1/2 c. butter, or two sticks.  Ummm, two stick be a whole cup, not a half.  I use a whole cup, two sticks, because I would rather ere on the side of caution.  However, despite the extra butter the recipe still turn out completely dry.  The bottom crust be dry, the top crust be dry, and the peach be dry.  Next, I wasn\\'t sure about the cook time.  The recipe say to bake until the peach bubbled, but mine never did.  Finally, the cheesecake layer disappear entirely.  I be look for a peach cheesecake dessert, and instead end up with a peach cake dessert with no hint of cheesecake.  Disappointing, for sure.',\n",

I make it at least once a month because I crave it!  Simple but soooo good!  I now add the ginger and it be good.  The only thing I do different be use wheat flour.  Mmmm! Perfect just the way it is!  And very easy to make.  I be skeptical at first with the combination of spices, I be not really a fan of chili powder.  But it works!  I would think that you could also use pork in this, think it would change the fat content, I'm sure. A keeper for u a we work on low fat in our diet and overall improve our eat habits.  My 7 year old daughter didn't care for it, but she like calamari and king crab so I be not worry about it! We have this dish tonight for dinner. It be awesome! So good! No need for take out anymore! YUMMY! This be super good. Like a sweet and sour chicken with KICK! I didn't add any of the basil/oregano/thyme just because I be not a fan and it be still phenomenal.

I do make a couple adjustments: I didn't have prune baby food, so I substitute 1/4 c. vanilla yogurt and I cut the sugar back to 1.5 cup because I don't like thing so sweet. All in all, they seem like a good treat and great way to sneak some fiber in. I'm hop my kid gobble them up!\",\n",

I also cut down on the can tomato on any soup recipe.  And I have can of beans, so rather than buy the dry bean I use those - couldn't tell the difference at all.  And I do blend about 1/3rd of the soup and return it to the rest in the pot.   I will make this again.  One note...on step #3 it say to remove the bone....never say when to put it in.  JS I be surprise you say nothing about the water that the ham bone be boil in. I would think that to discard this ham stock and replace with water would not add any flavor to the soup. My opinion be I be use this stock. I think you owe an explanation of what should be do with the water use to boil the Ham bone?\",\n",

I have do this in a slow cooker or on the stave top.

Thanks! 4 stars, very nice quick weeknight supper. nice flavour , the asiago cheese be a nice finish. I think next time I make it I would double the spinach.  I do have to use can mushroom but it work well and the dash of hot pepper flake be just right. Good luck in the contest. 4 Star - This recipe be easy to make but I find myself in the kitchen a little long then 15 minutes. The recipe taste very nice, the flavour combine together be great and I really be attract to the name of the recipe. Hubby and I really enjoy the meal. Little Miss (DD) didn\\'t eat it because she enjoy eat pasta, plain only this time it be in bow tie shape. Thank you RSC #11 Chef Easy to make and so tasty! I use chicken breast tender that i cut into cub and cook in my electric skillet. Loved the sauce with the spinach and mushrooms. DH enjoy this too and he isnt fond of spinach. Thank you so much for submit and best of luck in the contest. This dish be good. Not a big WOW, but good enough that we will try it again. Next time I\\'ll add in something for a little extra \"bite\". Maybe some fresh chop tomato or a chop red pepper. The finish touch of the asiago cheese be wonderful. A great flavor match for the rest of the ingredients.  Thanks! Quick save for me for dinner! High Five! Super easy to throw together and great for a family weeknight meal. Tasted Great and everyone love it! Good Luck Chef! This be fast, easy and delicious.  It\\'s one I\\'ll make often. Quick and easy recipe.  Everyone enjoy this.  Had no asiago or shallot at the store, so just add more garlic and use percorino romano.  Used half the pasta because we like extra sauce.  It be delicious. I make this tonight more or le to spec, and, while I like the consistency of the finish dish, I be a little disappoint in the overall lack of flavor.  \\n\\nThe chicken itself a prepare be bland, but the mushroom and aromatics do help to add some depth to the flavor.  To amp thing up a little, I decide to increase the cheese to a little under a cup and instead of just sprinkle it on, I mix it in at the end.  That really help to make the dish more interesting.  \\n\\nI think I will also season the chicken itself first next time and  make sure it get a little more brown prior to continue with the next steps.  \\n\\nI\\'m definitely go to make this again, a it do make for a reasonably quick meal and it be a pretty tasty dish overall. This be an easy to prepare meal.  Cooking time be right on. Flavors come together nicely and though it wasn\\'t a flavorful a I have hoped, It would be perfect a a side dish because it wouldn\\'t take away from a main dish...nice light flavor and very nice presentation. A definite keeper!  Quick to put together and very tasty.  The sauce be very light so to add a bite more bite I think this would be wonderful with just a bite of balsamic vinegar add to the sauce and some toast pine nut sprinkle over the finish dish.  This will be go into our weeknight rotation!  Thanks for sharing. My husband and I love it!. I use Parmesan cheese and it turn out delicious. It be really a keeper. Thanks I make this and it be good . I have to say it be a little bland.  In order to give the dish a little more flavor  I double the crush red dpeppers and add more cheese. This really spice it up. My family really like it. Thanks GREAT recipe. Made this last night for dinner guest & it be a big hit. It be completely & happily devour by all. \\nWe like it so much we be put it on the menu for ourselves this week.\\n\\nI do make a few adjustments, though. Added extra red pepper flake a we like a lot of spice, and instead of use flour a the thickener I use a tad of milk with a bite of cornstarch. I have make this recipe many times.  Each time it taste a little good and I can cook it a little faster.  I usually forget to get shallots, but onion work well.  I always have more garlic and more cheese. This be a good recipe, but I don\\'t like the sauce very much. The wine be very prominent, which do not appeal to anyone in my family. I make this a directed, except I use parmesean instead of asiago since it be what I have on hand! This be a very versatile dish. I can make it fast on a weeknight after work, but it taste \"fancy\" enough that it would be appropriate for guest a well! Thanks!',\n",

You just put lemon in your recipe's title and you get me! The taste of these crepe be amazing.  The lemon taste be just perfect.  It be very yummy with lemon juice and ice sugar.  I just have lot of problem to flip them.  I'm use to do thick pancakes.  Thin crepe be not my thing.  That's why I don't have a photo to post LOL  Thanks I'mPat :)  Made for the Australian Recipe Swap for November 2010 These be so easy to put together, but I find the mixture a little watery when cooking.  This make the crepe hard to turn around in the pan, but then again I make huge 20 cm crepe and I think they be only mean to be for small crepes.  However the whole family enjoy them for desert, we fill them with organic apple puree and cream.  Yum!  Thanks I'm Pat for post a wonderful recipe.\",\n",

Not overly sweet and with a salty taste that complete so well the sesame seeds. I use butter instead of margarine and that be great. You can't stop eat these little treats. Thanks. Delicious! Not too sweet, kind of like shortbread. My super-picky dad love them. I make these for my company Bakesale and they go very quickly. Oh yea, my husband love them a well. The prep time be a little long, but it be well worth it and they look so cute! Yum!  I pull this up when I be have a super sweet crave and not many ingredients.  I make them with Earth Balance to make them vegan, which make them a little bite crumbly, but that's to be expected.  Next time I'll use a little more preserve (I use blackberry) and a little le salt.  Very good and satisfy my sweet craving!\",\n",

I marinate my chicken for about 2 hours, grill it on medium heat and it be juicy in the middle and have a really nice tangy flavor to it, almost a lemony flavor. I follow the recipe a written, except have no curry so add a little red pepper. And I didn't save any marinade for dip - it only make just over 1/2 cup. Next time I might double the marinade and save 1/2 of it for dipping, but really the flavor be good enough that you don't need to dip the chicken. I might add a bite more hot pepper sauce next time just for more bite (or buy some curry). Definitely a keeper.\",\n",
       " \" The whole family think these be great! Does make a lot. We pig out and still have leftovers. The only way I deviate from the recipe be to decrease the amount of onion by 1/2 cup and let it bake a bite extra uncovered. Also, we use a big pan because they would not have otherwise all fit. We'll definitely be make these again. I want to try them with a homemade sauce and freeze a batch for later.\",\n",

I\\'m go to try it next a a presentation for saute veggies. BTW, the magazine it come from be Cuisine At Home.  I just get it recently and it be really informative and the recipe look so good. I love simple way to create pretty presentations, and this be certainly one. I think I need a little practice, though, a mine could have be a little thinner, which would have make them more \"lacy\". I have to let the cheese cool in the skillet for a few second off the heat before I could slide a spatula under it without mess it up, then I turn it over a ramekin (rather than a drink glass). I run across a recipe since I make this one that call for bake the cheese on a piece of parchment paper in the oven--after let it cool for a few seconds, you just pick up the parchment, flip it over whatever you be use to mold the baskets, then carefully remove the paper and form the cheese. I may try it that way next time, a I think it could possibly be easy to transfer a thin layer of cheese. In any case, this be a fun recipe--thanks for posting!',\n",

       " \" Something just after my fancy - easy to make and wonderful flavours. I couldn't get red snapper and so I use Tilapia instead and it be great. I like the combination of thyme and the fresh note of mint here. The cayenne add just a hint of sharpness. If you like it spicier, take 1/4 teaspoon or more of cayenne. I use red bell pepper here, because the sweet note be great with the mint flavours. Served it with bulgur. Thanks so much for sharing. The combination of flavor be wonderful. I do have to make some modifications, add several tablespoon of water to the sauce while it be simmering. Sliced the red onion thinly (use red if you can, it really make difference), do a chiffonade on the mint, mash the garlic... Since I can't get snapper, I try blue hake. Not a good choice. If you can get snapper use it, otherwise, perhaps, mahimahi, or tilapi would be best.\\nOther than that, with some modification, this be a truly good blend of flavors...\\nApplause, Potsie! We love the flavour in this dish!  I use snapper and add extra cayenne, and it be perfect.  I do need to add about 1/4 cup of water to the sauce in order for it to simmer.  Thanks for a fantastic recipe.  Can't wait to make it again! Absolutely wonderful! Instead of go through the process with the red pepper, I simply use jar sweet roast red pepper and it work wonderfully.  I add a few extra mint leaves, just because I like them and sprinkle some more cayenne pepper a the sauce be simmering.  I also use the advice of others to add 1/4 cup of water to the sauce.  All in all, this dish be easy, quick, and wonderful and my family really enjoy it. Excellent!!!!! use Mahi Mahi, Took Thorsten's lead and use more water *which I didn't need* and some extra cayenne * which I do need* Very very good. Made for ZWT3. This be another wonderful dish serve last night at our Egyptian theme dinner party.  It be easy to make and very festive in appearance.  Thank you so much for post !!! I think that this be a nice, easy to prepare snapper recipe.  I didnt serve it over the couscous---just with a side of cauliflower.  It make for a nice dinner--thanks! This be a quick, easy and delicately flavour dish that present beautifully  so would be ideal to serve at a dinner party.  I make it for two cut back on the onion, thyme and lemon juice, use one large cleave of garlic, 1 roast red pepper (purchased from the deli) along with extra cayenne and mint leaves.  There wasn't any sauce a such, more of a topping.  Not be sure the top would completely cover the fish, I add a little more oil and some water during step 2.  I bake the fish for twenty minutes, and add some freshly crack black pepper and sea salt to the finish dish. The fish be perfectly moist and tender.  The reason I'm rat it a 4 and not a 5 be solely due to our personal preference for more robust flavours. Thanks for a delicious recipe I look forward to make again!\",\n",
       " ' This be yummy. I add a little more suger because DH like his cornbread sweet.  It be easy to put together, only thing be I use about 2 1/2 cup cornmeal since that be all I had, so I compinsated and use a tad le flour also (about 2 cups), but it be still excellent. I have mine with butter and strawberry jam. Thanks for post this Made this up last night to go with a wonderful pot of Butter Beans, unfortunately the bread go so fast I didn\\'t even get a chance to take a picture.  Obviously this be a great recipe, thank you for post it. This be an excellent recipe.  I use Whole what flour (white wheat berry freshly ground), whole grain cornmeal, and soymilk for the milk.  I also add another 4 tablespoon sugar (organic unbleached cane sugar).  I have to add significantly more milk, (around two cups, I believe) probably because the whole grain soak up much more than refine grain would.  \\n\\nThe crust be divine.  By itself, it be slightly dry, but add some butter and it be awesome.  The best cornbread I\\'ve ever had.\\n\\nI\\'m go to use the recommend amount of sugar when I make it into cornbread stuffing.  My southern husband actually prefer Yankee cornbread (imagine that!) so I add a little more sweetness for him.  This cornbread be fantastic with strawberry freezer jam. I be so glad that I find this recipe.  I too have a 12\" lodge skillet and I need to make cornbread for a crowd.  I use this recipe and it couldn\\'t have be better.  The texture and flavor be perfect.  I haven\\'t have luck make cornbread in the past and usually just use the box mix, but now I don\\'t have to.  Thanks for the recipe. Excellent recipe.  I have always use a cast iron skillet to make my cornbread.  Instead of olive oil or canola for the skillet I preheat the skillet in the oven with at least a tablespoon or two of good ole bacon grease! Yummy. The only thing I change be use white cornmeal (it be what I had) and splenda sugar blend.  I should\\'ve add more sugar, since I like sweet cornbread.  I use a 10 inch pan and have to cook an additional 10 minute to make sure the inside be cook through.  It be a bite dry for my taste, but would probably be good with butter and jam, like the other reviewer suggested. Not sure what happen but this be a disaster.  I have make cornbread for year and have never have a fail like this one.  Tasteless.  Negative star if that be possible.  Sorry to the poster. This just didn&#039;t work for me. I make this last night to go with the chili we have for dinner. Loved it. Did the recipe exactly a it be write and it come out perfect. I will be make this a lot. I see muffin in the future also. I saw all the high star and print it out for my sister in law too. Coming back, I do see a bad review. Sure you make this recipe? You be definitely the odd man out a I go with the rest. This one be a keeper for me. Thanks for post an easy and delicious cornbread. NUMMY cornbread- thank so much! Great recipe! Walked my 12yr old through the step of the recipe &amp; it come out terrific! We&#039;re prepping for our thanksgiving dinner so our cornbread dress will be the bomb! Thanks! Followed the direction except I use a tsp of bacon grease for the skillet rather than the oil. Crust be crispy and the piece hold together well, minimal crumbling. Great with a bowl of bean and smoke ham! This be good but a little dry. With all the butter in it, it seem like it should have be moist. Next time, I might try add buttermilk, or maybe sour cream. I halve the recipe to cook it in a 6&quot; skillet. It still make at least 8 servings. Good recipe. Rises nice and hold together well. A couple of changes, I use Buttermilk along with regular milk for a light fluffy bread. 1-1/3 cup Buttermilk and 2/3 cup regular milk. Also use bacon grease in the pan instead of butter, but I think I either would be fine. Lastly, mix the milk and egg together first and add them to the dry ingredients. Once they\\'re thoroughly mixed, fold the melt butter in. Don\\'t over mix, just enough to blend it well. I should\\'ve keep a close eye on it because 20 minute in the oven make this way too dry. I will stick with my other cornbread recipe from now on. nan',\n",

The salad be terrific and I now have a great dress that I can use a few time during the week!  Autism Mommy you be right, no leftovers!  (Good thing I have some dress left!) Excellent salad!  It make a large salad that be so flavorful!  I make a post except I add a cut-up cucumber.  Even my DH who doesn\\'t eat salad very often, love this one.  Thanks for posting! Simple and perfect!  I love the tang that the lemon provide in the dressing.  The only change that I make be to omit the croutons, a I be not a fan.  Great salad! What a great salad!!  Made this last night and thoroughly enjoy it!!\\r\\nWonderful flavor, easy to assemble and look forward to share it with friend at summer gatherings.  This one be a keeper! Really great salad. I especially like the dressing! Kind of taste like BLT. I will definitely put this in the keeper file. The name do fit! We love this and it be a simple addition to our meal and many more to come. I make a half batch and it taste wonderful. Thanks for a great new salad recipe! I think you should call this \"That Great Salad\".  I follow this recipe to a \"T\" and it be delicious!  I entertain frequently and know my guest will love this.  The flavor of the cheese, bacon and onion be really enhance by the lemony, garlicky dressing.  Thanks for post Autism Mommy! Ooooo yummie!  That be SO tasty!  Thank you greatly for sharing.  I cut the recipe in half and follow all the direction to a \"t\".  I will definitely make it agin.  PS I save enough for lunch the next day and it be awesome! This be a nice, refresh salad that have a very natural flavor.  I love the combination o fingredients.  Next time I will reduce the mozzarella by about 1/2 and add a few croutons.  Overall it be delish!  Made for Fall PAC 2008. I take this to a dinner party and I be disappointed, although the guest say it be good.  Two pound of Romaine be WAY too much for this light dressing.  I make it exactly a stated, but I find it bland.  Two pound be a LOT of lettuce.  It look like the proper amount of lettuce after one pound and I should have stop there.  Also, with that amount of lettuce, it should have have more bacon and onion.  I even add a bite of oregano and extra black pepper, and a dash of hot sauce, but it be bland.  I think one and a half thin heart of romaine would be perfect. This salad be easy & quite good. The star of the recipe be the dressing! We love that. I will be make more of the dress to keep in the fridge for other salads. Thanks for sharing! I enjoy this salad very much. I scale it carefully for a small serving, but think the proportion be just right. Thank you very much for share this recipe with us. I use Recipe #92923 #92923, post by Jim in Washington, to make the croutons. This be the best salad! My family love it. My kid even gobble it up and have second which be unusual! lol! Our favorite dress to have with it be the homemade Good Season\\'s Italian.',\n",

We be the receipients of such a bottle a few month ago, and be just too embarrass to pas it on because we can't remember who give it to u in the first place, and we're sure it's be to every single house in the community.  So it's be sit in our wine cellar (actually, wine cabinet), gather dust and it must be a very depress bottle by now, watch other, more delicious and drinkable win come and go with impunity.  But along come French Tart and her Cava punch recipe to save the day, and this bottle's self-respect.  Okay, so it's not Spanish sparkle wine, it's Israeli fizzy stuff, and peach-flavored, which either add panache or insult, we're not sure.  We chill the bottle in the fridge overnight and the next morning mix it with the orange juice and LOTS of Cointreau.  Not bad, not bad, in fact, it's very nice.  Now, I'm not that enamor with this drink that I be actually go to go out and buy another bottle of this fizzy stuff.  I'm go to have to wait until one of the three remain bottle make it way to our house a a host gift in the next year or so.  What an interest and twist way to look forward to a drink! My husband and I LOVED this very refresh drink.  I use my juicer and leave the rind on the oranges...WOW!!! It do not get much more refresh than this!!  Made for ZWT3...a Toast to the Captains! Very good, light and tasty! Here in Greece it so easy to finD Valencia oranges, it a common variety. I add 1 tablespoon Cointreau in every glass, so it be a little strong! Its a keeper for the hot summer nights. Thanks for annother great recipe French Tart. Made it for ZWT 3. We drink this sit in the garden on a hot, sunny day.  I use Grand Marnier (out of Cointreau) and we happily sip away.  Lovely! Made this 'cava' punch use a local sparkle wine, Grand Marnier, and freshly squeeze juice from our own trees. Thank you French Tart, for a lovely refresh drink, so welcome on this hot August day. This drink be a delight! Sweet--yet tart *yes, like FTthe recipe poster*. LOL Made for Spanish Tapas Party Menue event. Local bartender in Valencia use a combination of vodka and gin, even rum (allwayas a clear liquor) instead of Cointreau. Its flavor and aroma kill the taste of freshlly squeeze oranges. Delicious! A kick up Spanish mimosa! I do pop the bottle in the freezer for a couple minute to chill.\\r\\nDelicioso! Pretty hard t o to give this one a 5 stars. Had all the good stuff in it...freshly squeeze orange juice and cointreau. I make this for WT 5 and we love it.Thanks for post Loved this!  I have a handful of fresh Valencia's, almost enough, but do use a little bite of cartoned juice.  I drink two (large) glass yesterday and two more today.  Naughty I know, but it be the weekend!  Thanks French Tart!  Made for the Saucy Senoritas ZWT5. I love this. I use store buy orange juice, though. It be like a mimosa. I make this for ZWT5.\",\n",

I make half the recipe and it be more than enough for two people.  I use a small cast iron fry pan and the meat brown nicely, and I drizzle some BBQ sauce on the top and put it in the oven uncover for the last 10 minute to brown.  Served it with green bean casserole.   This be GREAT!  I want meatloaf tonight, but didn't want to heat up the oven.  I substitute bread crumb for oatmeal, because that's what I had, and I only have one egg, it turn out TERRIFIC!  I make mash potato and a pan gravy to go with it, just make another batch of the ketchup, mustard, and worcestershire sauce, add beef stock and thicken with cornstarch, it be GREAT!!!  Thanks so much for this fabulous idea!!! This be a great, quick meatloaf.  I make half, and spread some barbecue sauce on the last five minutes.  My son have request meatloaf, and really like this one.  Thanks for a keeper! I'm not a big fan of meatloaf but I think this be delicious!   Instead of oat I use a cup of stave top stuff which turn out great.   Great alternative to bake and in my opinion better.   Put bbq sauce last few minute of cooking. This get mix review at my house. My young say this be the best meatloaf he ever ate, hubby didn't care for it at all and I think it be OK. I think it lack in flavor and be a bite mushy. It actually be good for me the next day but it definately need some ketchup to dress it up (or I'm sure the bbq sauce that others use would be good too). Next time I would add a sauce to the top and serve like that and I think we all would enjoy it. This do make a lot. I follow the recipe exactly a write other then I split mine into four mini loaves. This be a really great base recipe! I add some hungarian smoke paprika, salt, and some fresh basil. Instead of oat I use cornbread stuff mix (it's what I had, lol!). Also a the last five minute be slather on some JD no.7 BBQ sauce... And some cheese. It be amazing, flavorful, moist and delightful! Thank you for the inspiration! Delicious! I would have never think to try cook meatloaf on the stave top, but it work out really well. I use grind chicken, which need a little more season than beef, but it be a huge success! Been do this for years. I saut&eacute; mushroom and Onion and add to mixture with 1/4 cup Parmesan finely grate also 1/4 cup of Ketchup finely mince garlic an Italian seasoning. When complete in skillet. I top with Ketchup, Parmesan and bread Italian bread crumb and put the skillet under the boiler until bubbly and brown. This also add to the crispy bottom of the meatloaf. Delicious!\",\n",
       " \" This be sooo very good. I'm on the South Beach Diet and this fit in perfectly with the substitution of Splenda for the molassas, and I use light olive oil instead of the bacon grease.\",\n",
       " \" Great stuff!  The bacon, avocado and blue cheese go together so well.  I even like the dress despite the fact that I'm not into French dressing.  DH use a raspberry vinegrette that I have on his.  I'll be make this one often during the hot summer months. Great salad!  The dress be tangy and creamy  - a great combination. Light, but fill enough for a meal - this one a keeper. Fabulous!  Another winner, Cher!  The only thing I do differently be to use pepper bacon.  This be definately a keeper!\",\n",
       " \" I think the amount be off in this recipe; therefore, I'm not rat it. The oil and vinegar be overwhelming. Doubling the soy may help out the proportions. Perhaps the sauce be mean to be like this, but, for my tastes, it wasn't quite right.\",\n",
       " ' Very good!!!!! I make this to go with some chili and it pair up perfectly!!! I didn\\'t have yogurt or buttermilk, so I use sour milk (milk plus a little vinegar). Was still delicious!!! These muffin be excellent!  I grill some steak last night and be look for something with a little kick to spice up our meal and these fit the bill!  I make them with the optional cayenne and buttermilk.  They be super easy to put together.  Thanks for post a keeper! These be wonderful!  We make the recipe exact except we put cheese on the top of 11 of them before baking. The bake cheese really give it a little extra flavor that compliment the jalapeÃ±os.  Thanks, we will use this when we make chili again. These be great.  I make mine with egg substitute, and sprinkle cheddar over mine a well.  Nice kick but not overly so. Gorgeous muffins! Did not change a thing. I use yoghurt, that\\'s what I had. I serve it with Uncle Bill\\'s Recipe #81419. Thanks, FT, for share yet another one of your wonderful recipes. Definitely will be make it again! I make this recipe twice in the last week and it be fast, easy and absolutely delicious both times.\\r\\nThe first time, I use yogurt and put the batter in 12 heart-shaped pan for garnish to my donation to a potluck wed reception.  The batter be thick.  The result be moist and I have only one \"broken heart\" when I cart them to the wedding.\\r\\nThis morning, I make the recipe for breakfast and use powder buttermilk and 1/2 cup jalepeno juice and 1/2 cup water for the liquid.  The batter be thin but equally good.  I be afraid tha the muffin would rise too high if I fill the 12 muffin cup too full so I spread it across 18 cups.  It doesn\\'t expand too much in the oven ... I\\'ll use the recommend 12 muffin cup from now on.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis be a definite keeper in my over-flowing recipe file! Absolutely divine!  We have these little delight for dinner tonight.   I do add the cayenne pepper and use buttermilk.  I think I have jalapeno pepper but do not and add dice green chilies since that be what I have on hand.  I make a full batch and freeze  in baggies for future treats.  Thanks FT.  Made for Ausie Swap #21. Awesome cornbread muffins!! I use a little le jalapeno and add in 1/4 cup or more of shred cheddar cheese. Yumm! I\\'ve make these several time now and always get compliment on their tastiness. Thanks for add the recipe. Made these little muffin to go with a big pot of chili this weekend and they be great. I add some sharp cheddar cheese to mine like some of the other reviewer and we love them. Thanks for posting. Just finish make and taste these muffins.  I be not impress with the taste...I find them a litle dry and boring.  I follow direction exactly but I really think it would have more zip.  Sorry!  One good thing tho\\' they didn\\'t crumble which be a definite plus! These muffin be really really tasty and I serve the along side a Mexican Tortilla soup - a perfect combination. I omit the cayenne pepper. We will be make these again for sure. Made for Family Picks ZWT5 Perfect in everyway!  I make these to go with Smokey Black Bean Soup, recipe #347403.  The muffin be light but firm. I use fresh dice jalapeno pepper and yoghurt.  The next day I split the muffins, spread with a dash of butter and place in a cover pan for a few min.  Ooh! So good, serve with our spanish style egg for breadfast the next day. I pop the last 2 muffin in the freezer.  They can be freeze and when reheat be just like fresh baked.  A \"winner\" recipe.  Thank you French Tart I will first have to say that I be not bear with a bake gene.  In fact, I break out in a cold sweat, and my heart start pound when I even think about make an attmept....However, the muffin turn out to be the most perfect that I have ever make or had, for that matter.  Perfectly season and savory.  I add about 1 cup of cheddar cheese to the batter, and I use fresh chop jalapenos.  Baked for  21 minute and perfectly browned.  Made for Kittencal\\'s Muffin Tag and enjoy immensely!!  I be forever grateful to you FT, for my first bake success! Made these to serve with last night supper soup. They be a WOW. Absolutely awesome, have to be one of the best corn meal muffin we have ever tasted. Dh love them. Didn\\'t have the jalepenos, snip in two of the long slim super hot Kung Paos I have grow in large pots. Knowing how hot they be I go with 1/8 th teaspoon of the cayenne. On line calculator convert the 4 ounce of butter to  8 tablespoons. With a dozen muffin on the table call and have dd pick some up for her supper to avoid far temptation!

You can alter the kick, but they be very moist and not super sweet like a lot of cornbread recipes.  Not a fan of sweet cornbread, thank you so much for sharing! Nice muffin. Thanks for posting. Loved these. I make 2 batches, the first base on the actual recipe, and for which I give 5 stars, the second batch I add 1/2 cup Monterey jack/cheddar cheese and use fresh jalapenos. After baking, I split in half and serve cream cheese/pepper jelly combo with them. Turned out great!!! Made these to go with deer chili and I will definitely be make again! It come out fine and taste good. But I follow the recipe exactly and the dough be very dry. I have to add about half a cup of milk to get it all mix in.

       " \" This recipe be a great easy meal in one dish. I cook for just myself, so I cut the recipe in half and use a 8x8 square bake dish. I also add 4 oz of slice fresh mushroom since I love mushroom and use regular cheddar cheese instead of low-fat. I think you could easily add pepper if you like them too. For be low-fat, this be darn good!  I honestly think that I'd have to add extra seasonings/spices, but all I do be add a bite of Worcestershire sauce and that's the only change I made.  We love it.  Nobody would ever guess the fat content be so low.  Thanx for post this; it's a definite keeper! We love this recipe.  My only suggest change be to skip step 8 until after step 11.  Mixing the cheese sauce into the beef mixture in the bake dish it fill to the rim be a recipe for a mess.  \\n\\nNext time I may try the Worcestershire sauce a another reviewer suggested, just out of curiosity to see if it could make it even better. This be tasty and light.  We use dreamfields low carb pasta and one serve (about 2/3 cup) be good with veggie for my husband, who be diabetic.  It's very filling.  I agree it might be aid with a little bite of extra spice/worcestershire sauce since light cheddar be mild. Simple but good. Everyone enjoy this. I follow the recipe a write other then I use 2 8 ounce can of tomato sauce. I also just use sharp cheddar cheese and I didn't add the nutmeg a I didn't have any. This make for a greak weeknight meal. I also like that it be make with ingredient I normally have on hand. We enjoy this recipe. I halve the recipe but keep the beef the same for my boyfriend. I do not have carrot so I mix in some corn for the crunch. I also use whole grain shell pasta and pasta sauce  instead of tomato sauce just because of what I have in the cupboard. So much good than hamburger helper and I actually know what I'm put in the pan, thanks!! Well, this be another 5 stars. Not only be this easy to prepare but very tasty for a light dish. I cut the recipe in half and it make enough for DH and I for dinner and some leftover for his lunch at work. I make note to add Worcestershire sauce and some mushrooms, :( but forgot. Not sure if it would improve the flavor. Overall a wonderful light recipe that I plan to make often. Thanks for posting. :) Made for Spring PAC 2010 5 Shinning stars! I make this yesterday for lunch and I come back for seconds. Yes. it be that good. I use celery and green pepper and it be delicous. A must try recipe. Thank you Vicki. So much good than Hamburger Helper!!  I also love sneak in the carrots.  We do add some green pepper.  My only comment be that I would not add a much black pepper next time.  It just seem too much.  Thanks so much!  Definitely a keeper! Wow! This be a really surprise hit. I do not like grate the carrots, but if you use a really fine grater, you neither taste nor see the carrot when it's done. So, if your kid have hawk eye about veggies, use a superfine grater. It take forever to do this by hand, but it's worth it. The roux mix with the cheese be a genius maneuver. It make it taste much more cheesy than it actually was. I also grate the garlic just to save myself the sticky fingers. I add in a bite of basil, oregano and parsley, and the spice level be perfect for us. With my gestational diabetes, I be able to have 1 1/2 cup of this with a side salad, and it fill me up without blow my carb limit. Thank you! Great casserole! I love Cooking Light recipe and they do a great job with this one. Using a cheese sauce make this rich without be fatty. Prepared the night before and bake at dinner time which work well. Leftovers be good, too. All I have be 85/15 grind beef, so I cook it, drain thoroughly on paper towels, then add in the onions, garlic, and finely shred carrot to cook for a few minutes. Definitely a repeat at my house, the whole family enjoy it. Thanks for share the recipe! Great recipe,thanks for post it!<br/><br/>I be try to come up with something different to do with grind sirloin.We be all get tire of the usual thing to use it for chili,tacos,spaghetti sauce,burgers etc.It be very cold here today and this be warm, fill comfort food.I really love the fact that it be low in calorie per serving.(I didn't tell my husband or little one that though;)I leave out the carrot because a one other reviewer said,I have a couple of hawk eye here.LOL! I only use 1/4 tsp of pepper(I figure we could add more when serving)and it be perfect.My daughter gobble hers up without a complaint and believe me thats 5 star right there because she's VERY fussy!Thanks again for this recipe I will definitely make it again and again.

Thank You for another keeper. I really like how the Little Smokies lend a nice light smoky flavor to the rest of the soup. I only have maybe 3/4 to 2/3 of a package of Little Smokies left, so that's what I used. I use 16 oz of Velveeta instead of Cheez Whiz, and I may have use few potato than what it call for, I didn't measure them, and I forget how many I used, I think 4 bake potatoes, maybe? Instead of use celery, I chop up some carrots. I believe I also add some freeze corn to it, a well a possibly some chop onion and green pepper? (I make it a while ago, and I can't remember!) All in all, it be delicious, and easy to add more stuff to it and customize it to your taste. A great way to use up a package of Little Smokies!

       " ' holy crap this be good. I have make this twice now, and my family LOVES it!  Just delicious! Absolutely scrumptious! I use fillet steak, add the mustard with the cream etc (doesnt say when too in recipe) Absolutely delicious, sure make a change from bore old steak! 3 out of 5 love it!! Can\\'t wait to try this again. Fabulous recipe! I always fancy go to the Witchery, but it\\'s MUCH too pricey for my budget. This one definitely go into my \"Dinner Party\" book and it will be serve the next time we have guests. Truly mouth-watering steaks. I use homemade beef broth, just to keep the sodium down. We eat at the Witchery during a trip to Edinburgh many year ago. Thanks for the memories. And for the fabulous recipe! If you want to splurge on the cals and treat your steak to a wonderful sauce, then this be the recipe for you.\\r\\nI could go on all night, but \\'nuff said!\\r\\nI must tell you though, that I cook the mushroom in a big pan alongside the steak, because I like my mushroom well done, and I use light cream which work just fine. One word:  Excellent!  Be forewarn about flame the Scotch -- STAND BACK -- I didn\\'t expect such a LARGE flame-up. After seven try to light the whiskey it evaporate on me. What a waste of good Scotch. I be anticipate this huge whiskey explosion and be timidly try to light the stuff. Then I have to have a dram myself which steady my nerves; pour more in the pan and it light the first time! The only thing I do differently be BBQ the steak in the freeze cold with snow all about. Absolutely wonderful recipe. I think next time I\\'ll ditch the steak and just make a huge pot o\\' sauce and pretend it\\'s soup! Very nice. Next time I\\'ll deepen the flavour with some good whiskey, and aim for a slightly thick sauce. The dish be quite handy for timimg; once fry the steak keep well for quite a long time in the sauce. This dish be absolutely delicious.  We follow the recipe but use nice filets.  It shock the kid when we light the pan on fire (it be quite spectacular), but the house be still stand and we have the most wonderful meal.  The mushroom pull in the flavor of the sauce, which be incredibly creamy...a great combination.  I\\'d love to visit the Witchery, but in the meantime, I\\'m quite happy to pretend at home with this meal.  Thanks for post this! This be delicious and be a recipe I will keep and make often.  I didn\\'t use the mustard but that be just a preference.  It turn out great and the sauce taste good on mash potato too! Incredible!!  My hubby and I be fortunate enough to have eat at the Witchery when visit Great Britain this summer, so I really want to try this recipe.  It be unbelievable!  My husband comment that it be like we be eat a $120.00 meal at home.  The only change I would make would be to add even a few more mushroom to the sauce.  Thanks for share this beautiful recipe!! Dianne DH say this be a 3-star - but I\\'m be generous. I don\\'t know what we\\'re missing...we didn\\'t care at all for this sauce. Followed direction exactly, except grill the steak and also double the mushroom for personal preference.\\r\\n\\r\\nI dunno - not sure what we\\'re missing...Better luck to the rest who try this recipe! HOLY COW. This be wonderful stuff. Hubby and I both love it - and a guest who come over before we be quite do eat it sniff and ask \"What be that wonderful smell?\" (Plus, I make hubby light it, and he stand there entrance by the beautiful flame flicker over the surface of the pan...) Two thumb (and one nose) up. Extremely good! This be a really wonderful recipe for special occasions.  Thank you for sharing. This be really good. We start some on the grill and some in the pan; the one on the grill have too much smokey taste for the sauce but those do in the pan be nice. Made this for New Years and the friend & family like the flame pan. omg..  try new recipe a 4y/o daughter be GF...  my husband be rave the rest of the night say it be the best steak he\\'d have in year or maybe EVER..  restaurant quality...  (i ask him if he be serious or just suck up!)  He say I\\'m dead serious!!  I try it and about died...  sauce be wonderful... I felt like \\'Emeril\\' set it on fire.. it be great!!! Absolutely gorgeous, I have make steak before with several sauce and this be close to one of mine, without be exact. What a lovely flavour work really well. Have ignite sauce before, but it be such a novelty and guest really enjoy it. Hubby think it be delicious, and I have to say Yum, Yum. Made it with fillets, so more expensive cut, but the sauce be outstanding. I do add 1 cleave of garlic to mushroom and cook seperately a janroundoz say prefer my mushroom brown (well done.) also. But final result outstanding, thank for sharing. YUM, SCRUMMY. YUM This be the best meal I have ever made.  If I could give it 10 star I would.  My family and I would love to thank you for a wonder meal experience.  I follow the recipe exactly except I have to triple all the ingridients because there be a few people in the house.  The only different thing I have to do be add a little cornstarch to get it thicker, but I think this happen because I have to go by my own measurement due to the ammount I made.  Again Thank you!!!! I cannot overstate how fabulous this was. We make it for Christmas and it be perfect. Even after the sauce get a bite lukewarm (because I bite off more cook than I could chew) several people say it be the best meat dish they ever had. Not too shabby, huh? Truly, a recipe to keep for a lifetime, and pas on. YUM!!!.  The sauce be FANTASTIC!!  Love this recipe! We like this recipe.  We make it with ribeye steaks.  Be careful a the dish really flame when the whiskey be set on fire.  Needed quite a bite of salt in my opinion, but all in all, it be nice.  Thanks! This be a fabulous special occasion dish.  I have make it three times, and I use filet mignons with great success.  I do cook my mushroom first and then add them back into the sauce a it help get rid of some of the liquid the mushroom release. I have be use this recipe from the Rampant Scotland website - didn\\'t realize it be post here - so glad you add it to the Zaar collection a it be spectacular. I have be cook Steak Balmoral for over thirty year now. The recipe list be very good but I caramelise onion (1/2 rings) just after I cook the steaks. This make a nice difference to the dish. <br/>I have always use Eye Fillet in my recipe a it\\'s a \\'no fail\\' cut of meat.<br/><br/>ash',\n",

       " \" I'm not a big eggplant fan so I can't give this 5 star but the sauce be soooooo yummy.  My kid and their friend like this recipe so it must be good! We love this recipe and I will make it again, but I will probably cut down on the grape jelly because we find the sauce a bite too sweet. It's similar to The Olive Garden's Eggplant Parmigiana, but not quite a good. Worth make though if you enjoy the restaurant's version. I have always love eggplants.  Took a few year to convince the family to love them.  This be a good recipe, however, I've never think about the jelly, now I know why.  When people want a sweet taste in the food, I add jus a pinch at the end of cooking, so not to be to sweet.\",\n",

I do eliminate the salt & replace the bouillon cub with homemade stock in an effort to reduce the sodium.  I also didn't use the optional Dale's Seasoning, but do include the worcestershire.  I  find the gravy very salty  and when I make this again would attempt to far reduce the salt.  That said, the flavor be good and the recipe be a definite keeper.  Made for the Dec P-A-R-T-Y event.

As a fellow torontoanian, It be great to see someone with a real sence of toronto and canadian pride. Now,if only I could snatch some of the recipe I love from the CNE food building... that would be heaven!! I have a very similar recipe that I've be make for years.  However, it just didn't taste like I remember them.  After try your recipe today, I know I have find the *Secret* ingredient.  It have to be that tiny bite of cinnamon.  What an amaze difference it makes.  Thanks Chef Dee, for set me straight. This be very very close to my mom's recipe that she have be make every Halloween for 40 years.  She sprinkle white sugar on the cookie sheet then set the candy apple on that.  They don't stick to the pan and they have a sugary bottom that harden and make it easy to wrap in plastic wrap.  I prefer the candy to the candy apple anymore.  There isnt many kid leave at home anymore but on Halloween all the past kid come knock on the door.  It wouldnt be halloween without her candy apples. These be easy to make. It take long for the temperature to reach 300 because you have to wait for the water to boil off.  So, don't worry that it isn't go a fast a you think.  Also, use a small pot so the liquid be deeper.  I also do what another reviewer suggest and sprinkle a cookie sheet with sugar to set the apple on.  I also take the leave over candy and pour it into little tart pan and make candy discs.  I will make this recipe again.  Thanks for sharing. Very easy to make, and use the leftover to make hard candy be a great idea! I add some extra cinnamon with the food color at the end to brighten up the flavor after cook so long I be DEVESTATED. I make these for a very important event and use this recipe b/c it be suppose to be &quot;easy&quot;. I do everything the resipe say and  when I check the apple this morning the candy on the apple never get hard and it like SYRUP. SO dissappointed. I would like to emphasize that let the liquid boil until it reach 300 degree be a CRUCIAL step to make this EASY Candy Apples! At the beginning, I bring the liquid to a rapid boil, add cinnamon and food coloring, then start dip the apples. The candy coat didn&#039;t stay at all. I coat the apple twice. The result be still disappointing. I know that I must be do something wrong, then I go through the recipe again and notice that I be suppose to let the liquid boil for a little longer. So I bring my saucepan back to high heat and watch the water boil away. When I dip the apple in this time, the coat stay perfectly. It do firm up really quickly though. I would recommend work fast. Over all, this be a good recipe for Halloween! We just melt redhots down dip the apple in it. Let them setup in refrigerator. Alot easier.\",\n",

We both love it, DD even comment on how good it taste and the chicken be moist and not chewy like some chicken can be. Had this with just a regular salad and Italian dressing. Worked really well. Thanks for this great recipe. I COULD NOT GET ENOUGH OF THIS!! What a delicious dinner! I do use oil instead of butter after read other comments. Skewered it with red onion, red peppers, zucchini, mushrooms, and pineapple chunks. I also reserve the marinade and boil it down to make a sauce and serve everything over rice. This one be a definite keeper! I agree with others that this make for a delicious dinner! The weather didn\\'t cooperate with grill tonight, but these do just fine under the broiler. I must have have large veggies, a my skewer be very crowded! My only regret be that I have to use can pineapple, which definitely lose a little something.I use oil like other reviewers, though I will try butter next time because I think the flavor would be delightful.

Oh I use orange pepper  Loved it again Thanks HeatherFeather I use regular red pepper, may try the roast next time.  I do know that I want to add some fresh mushroom the next time.  Good versatile recipe. I make this for my kid for lunch today.  They love how the egg and toast already come connected.  I end up eat the vegetables.  I think this be go to be one of their favorite and it be really quick and easy.  My daughter love pour the egg in the middle of the bread. The flavour blend well in this recipe.  I keep the onion/pepper mix hot in the microwave while I cook the bread & eggs.  Will make this often. Only thing I do do different be to sprinkle chop parsley over the onion/pepper mix to give a contrast of colours.  Thanks for post this \\'keeper\\' :) As in movie, and for myself, I would probably forgo the thinly slice onion except to add thinly slice upper portion of scallion scatter around the edge of a serve plate for presentation. In the movie we don\\'t see any onion be used. But for those who like onion(s), sure why not? I\\'d stick just with a slice or two of roast red pepper (canned/bottled). The crush garlic cleave do get my attention though. I\\'ve always make my \\'Eggs in Nest\\' with extra sourdough bread spread on some soft butter/margarine and sprinkle with grate parmesean cheese. Toasts up to a great tasty crunchy golden brown on a cast iron skillet. Deliciousness on a piece of toast.  Sticks with you until noon too.  I burn the bottom of the bread, but that actually taste good.  Put a little butter substitute on the bread and sprinkle a bite of garlic powder over it before toast it in the pan.  Good work, Heather! Growing up, my mom make \"eggs in a nest\" too. She use the rim of a drink glass to cut out the middle of the bread and serve the little round toast on the side. Yummy. \\nAn old roommate use to tear out the middle in a square. She call them \"Window Pane Eggs\".

They add such great flavor. I be not a fish liker, but try this to appease my husband.  I absolutely love it.  The marinade only take minute to make and I be tell it be a keeper by the whole family. I be unable to get Halibut so use Mahi Mahi and Salmon.  We both enjoy the fish although it take considerably long to cook on our grill.  Next time I will increase the heat on the grill.  Thank you for this recipe.  It be definately a keeper! This be pretty easy to prepare and definitely healthy, but I felt it be lacking...something. I expect strong flavor from the combination of such great ingredients, but I could mostly just taste lemon (which I cut back to 4 T base on other reviews). My fish also take MUCH long than the prescribe 2-3 minutes/side to cook to 140 degree internal temp. About 12 minute per side on medium heat. Sorry to say but this recipe didn't stand out for me. Easy to make and delicious. Made this without the tomatoes, lemon zest and caper because I do not have these on hand. I think the amount of lemon juice be just right, but we like lemon on our fish. Great recipe. Delicious!! Used 4 T. of lemon, but follow the recipe otherwise. Thanks for share this keeper recipe!\",\n",
       " ' I add some essence of Emeril orginal seasoning, and use butter herb instand mash potato (that be what I have in the house). I use 2 can of gravy rather than package gravy mix (again it be what I have in the house) I be awsome!! This be a \"must have\" recipe for college student and begin cook a it be SO EASY--especially if you use can gravy and instant potatoes.  My kid didn\\'t complain about eat their vegetable either!  I will be cook this often on \"soccer night\" when I have no time to fix dinner. My whole family LOVES this - my daughter, who can be finicky, ask me to make it again the next night. I only make 2 package of gravy & it seem to be plenty. The potato need to be fairly stiff - the 1st time I have make them too creamy & it turn out on the soupy side (although my daughter insist she like it that way). I really enjoy this and will definitely be make this in the future.  I make it just a the recipe state too. Thanks so much for share it with us. This be very good.  DH be a little disappoint that it be like a pot pie with no crust...that\\'s his favorite part.  I might try this in a pie shell and serve mash potato on the side.  It be a very good recipe though.  Thanks for posting!',\n",
       " \" I make this recipe several week ago, but apparently my original review didn't go through.  This be a delicious bread and very easy to make.  Thanks bunch for post the recipe pinky kookie! 1/2 hour into bake the top be brown and almost burndt...i have to move it down 1 rack to the bottom 1/3 of the oven...wish i would have know to do this from the receipe..\",\n",
       " ' We enjoy this very much, but too salty for our taste. Will certainly make it again but will use in the marinade and the sauce one tablespoon le fish sauce. The ginger really come through and the peanut be also very nice and give it a crunch. ',\n",
       " ' This be an excellent dish, and it be quite simple! I use turnip instead of parsnip, and roll the cobbler, a suggested, I also remove the bay leaf before put the cobbler on. A new favorite dish, that I will make often! Thanks! I make some change because of item I do not have, however, I think it turn out very good! I think I might consider throw some bake powder/soda into the \"cobbler\" in order to make it more biscuit like.  Didn\\'t change a thing.  My entire family like it and that doesn\\'t happen very often.  Only complaint be that there wasn\\'t enough.',\n",
       " ' Definitely a keeper.  Very easy and quick.  I agree with another comment make , that I would add a touch of pArsley.  The butter be way too much for me, next time I will just use a half stick , Overall very good and it be a keeper  Herb in San Diego Very good.  Next time I will cut down on the butter, and add more water.  I use HerbOx boullion cubes. Wonderful!!!!!!!!!1111 My teenage kid love it a well a my husband - the best.  I increase the amount of water use and only use 1/2 stick of butter total.  The sauce be still great.  MMMM!! Very good and quick to make. My family eat the whole bowl. Thanks for the easy recipe. Very good, quick and easy to make.  If I have fresh parsley on hand next time I think I may add just a touch of them. I make the mistake of try to use shell instead noodles,the result be the dish run out of broth before the shell be done.But even though they be alittle crunchy(dummy me!)they have good flavor.I will definately make this again use the right ingredient next time. This be such a simple and easy recipe to make that I be surprise at how good the noodle tasted.  Given that the recipe call for 1/2 cup butter I be surprise that it wasn\\'t greasy.  Instead, they have the hint of chicken broth couple with a creamy texture - yum be all I can say.  My 5 yr old daughter tell me that these be \"really good noodle and that she might have 2nds.\"  These will definitely be a staple at our dinner table in the future a my little one love noodle and I make them often.  I think I\\'m go to try to cut back a little on the butter to reduce the fat content a bite but not enough to sacrifice the creamy texture.  Thanks for a really good recipe. I wont make plain old noodle any other way. I think it\\'s important to let people know that the broth wont cover the noodle and that they need to stir frequently though. I didn\\'t have a problem but some might.Family love it, give these a try This be the best butter noodle ever, and my picky son just love it. Very easy to prepare and I only use a half stick of butter and add more water.Yummy! My 7 y/o daughter be in that really annoy phase of pickiness extreme. This recipe tame her down quickly!  Wow, the sense of contentment make for what be quickly become a very stressful time of our night, a pleasure again. THANK YOU We all be pasta nuts, especially my 12 year old daughter.  She think these taste just like the Lipton one in the pouch.  Noodles don\\'t get much good than this!  Half a stick of butter be more than enough for u too. These noodle be so easy to prepare and the taste be excellent! The only change I would make be to add 1/2 cup more water to boil the noodle in. I run out of water before the noodle be tender.  Great recipe, David!  Thank you! Excellent taste - use whole cup of butter and be way too greasy.  Next time, will use only half a others have stated.  Thanks for a good recipe. Very, very good.  I use a can of chicken broth, a bite more water, 12 oz. of noodle & only 1/2 cup of butter.  I will never make regular butter noodle again.  The broth add much flavor & the butter make it sooo creamy.  YUM! These be really good.  I use 1/2 cup unsalted butter and it be still a bite greasy.  I\\'m think of decrease the butter by 1 T next time, to see if that will make a difference.  I use 1 1/2 cup water and 2 teaspoon of chicken bouillon granuals.  The liquid doesn\\'t cover the noodles, so it\\'s important to stir constantly until the noodle be done.  An addition of parsley just before serve might be nice to add a little color.  These be pretty good.  Kind of like an egg noodle risotto!  I add some fresh chop parsley and some garlic powder for a little extra flavor.  I cut back the butter a tad also.   Wow!  Add me to the list of people who find it hard to believe that something this simple could be so delicious!!  This recipe be outstanding! I follow the instruction exactly and do not add any extra butter.  Creamy and delicious egg noodles!  Thanks for sharing.\\r\\n Oh my, my these be wonderful.  I add several different fresh herb and the flavor be wonderful.  Cut back on the butter a little bite and they didn\\'t seem to need more.   This be definately a great way to serve noodles.  We change the bouillion to beef to serve with a Crockpot Herved Steak meal and it turn out delicious.  Thanks for such an easy recipe.   10 time good than stor buy package butter noodles, even use the extremely thin egg noodles, AWESOME!!!!!! I can\\'t believe this many review for such an easy recipe! It\\'s great! Without know this be a new recipe, my husband declare upon his first bite \"These be the best noodle I\\'ve ever eaten.\" I ask him if he have read the print-out of this recipe with the comment and he have no idea. Thanks for this great method. Thanks David for an awesome recipe.  I pair this recipe with Marie\\'s Jumbo Shrimp Parmesan #42169 and it make for a great marriage. Great taste noodle and so simple to make...we love them. I add alittle fresh parsley. Thanks David  Great recipe! I do use OXO chciken boullion powder packet instead of Wyler\\'s cubes, but it turn out great anyway. I serve this with my easy chicken parmesan recipe#58229 and it be delicious and easy! Thanks for posting! try this use beef boulion and it be great!!served it with beef tip and gravey. These noodle be so delicious and extra easy to make! I serve them with Beef Patties in Onion Gravy #37413 and it be a perfect combination. I will use this recipe over and over again. Thanks so much for post it! This be so easy and go over really well with my family. I\\'ll be make it again for sure. Made these to have for lunch on a cool Sunday afternoon. My family eat it up! Very good and quick too. Thanks. Served this last night and DD love it.  Very easy. I make this the other night and be not impressed.  The recipe be very easy and quick.  I love pasta and butter but this be just not for me.  The chicken bouillon in this be just not my cup of tea.     These be not necessarily \"creamy\" but very good, nonetheless!! I will make these often for my family! YUM!!! Speedy and simple, this be a real keeper for homestyle dinners. I double the recipe except for the butter, keep that about 3/4 - 1 stick, and find it to be a good balance; still a bite greasy but good flavor. I keep the pan cover when I wasn\\'t stir (do stir often!)to try and keep a much moisture in a possible but still need to add about 1/3 c extra water near the end to get the noodle to our desire consistency (perhaps due to le butter?). With the sodium in the boullion cubes, we definitely didn\\'t need any salt at the table, lol. I think this could be a good basis for one pot dinners...add in freeze pea and cook chicken, or use beef boullion and add in mushroom and cook grind beef, etc. I serve this with Super Simple Crockpot Chicken and Gravy #98380 and they work well together. This will definitely go in our menu rotation...thanks! :o) My wife be like,\"why be you look for a recipe for butter noodles?\" I say I be look for something different. She roll her eyes. I make this reipe and she ask me to make it 3 time already! :) I only use a half cup of butter and that be perfect! I use the less amount of butter and add a little more water. These be great.\\r\\nAnd will definitely make them again.\\r\\n These be good, though a little \"greasy\" because I do use the full stick of butter. I use a can of chicken broth because I could not find my bullion cub ANYwhere.  It work just fine, but I will try the recommend way (with a little le butter) next time. Thanks for the easy, delicious recipe.  It be a family hit! Thanks for the super easy recipe.  I be always look for a quick recipe for my kids.  It be a hit with them!!  Next time I be go to add a little steam broccoli for myself. Very good, very easy!  I do make a 12 oz bag, so I up the water to 2 1/4 cup and do 3 cubes, and 1/2 stick butter.  I keep cover on medium and stir often, but have to add about 1 cup more water! I do not add more butter.  Served with brocolli and grill chops.  The kid love them.  So much good than the package mixes.  Thanks for sharing.  I do think a whole stick (which would be 1/2 cup) butter would be way too much, so one cup (2 sticks???) would be excessive.  Surely you didn\\'t mean cups??? 1/2 stick be perfect! This be just a terrific recipe that produce creamy buttery saucy noodles.  I only use 1/4 cup butter during the cook and do not add any butter at the end and they be still outstanding....Thanks for this super recipe....  Excellent noodles!  I make exactly a described, add another 1/2 stick of butter during the last minute of cooking.  I love butter, but this have just a little too much butter for our taste with just the minimum call for here.  Also, I use regular salt butter, and it be just a touch salty for us.  Next time, I would decrease the amount of butter and use unsalted butter (or use a low-sodium chicken broth instead of the bouillon cubes) and I have no doubt it will be a 5-Star recipe for us!  Thanks for share this.  Dianne Excellent noodles!  I make them exactly a post and I be a little nervous since there be more noodle than water.  I stir alot (like the other reviewer) and I also cover the pan which helped.  All be well in the end ~ the noodle be wonderful!  Thank you for post the recipe. I will never make plain old noodle again.  Even my VERY picky 22 month old eat a bowl full!! I agree it\\'s important to let people know that the broth wont cover the noodle and that they need to stir frequently.  I love this dish!! These be very tasty.  Next time I will use 2 c. h20 and only 1/2 a stick of butter.   This recipe really doesn\\'t need another review, do it, but these noodle be very, very good. It\\'s a little on the decadent side, what with all the butter, but once in awhile you have to indulge! The hard part be go to be to not indulge a often a I\\'d like! As others said, it\\'s important to stir the noodle frequently. My whole family enjoy this dish. Thanks for posting! An excellent way to serve noodles. Sometimes I add dill when we have Swedish Meatballs.  Thanks for a great recipe. Excellent and easy.  Thank you! This be an excellent way to prepare noodles! I will never eat them plain again. Very easy to make. Delicious! My kid love noodle this way!  Thanks for a great and easy recipe.  I use 1/2 the butter and they be still great. What can I say, easy and delicious. I have be make butter noodle for years, tipically just boil noodle and then add salt and butter. This be sooo simple but what a difference. I do use egg dumplings, just a personal preference. This be just inhale at my house. Thanx for great recipe. My daughter Emily love them! She could eat them breakest, lunch, & dinner!!! I have to agree with one of the other posters, someting this easy just ain\\'t suppose to be this good. I make it a write b/c I feel we owe that to the post chef. I do feel it be too buttery for me, but that be easily fixed. I make it a written, like I said, however, next time will use my standby unsalted butter and low sodium Herb ox bullion. There be so many addition that come to mind with this recipe. Fish pieces, shrimp, veggie of different kinds, olives, mushrooms,  etc. A very good recipe, David, I wish I have find it sooner. A Real keeper, thank for post it.\\r\\njim These noodle be pretty good. Fixed them for my grandkids and they scarf them down.  The only thing be when you drain, you seem to drain all the yummy out.  I\\'m sure I will make again. These noodle be very good and enjoy by all. Thanks David Ball.... David, thank you. I have to appease the palate of a picky 8 year old boy whose sole mission be to see how many noodle he can eat in his lifetime. He tell me, and I quote: \"These be the best noodle ever\". Slighty variation: I boil the noodle in plain water, drained, heat up a pan, melt the butter until it be nutty and fry the noodles. They be lightly crispy . A lifesaver recipe. PS for the bouillion cub I sub chicken base. I also suggest his parent have their son\\'s cholesterol checked. ;) These work so well for us! Not only do they taste wonderful but I have a tiny kitchen and not have to drain the noodle be a huge help for me.  I didn\\'t use Wyler\\'s chicken cubes, I use a teaspoon of Watkin\\'s in some homemade broth and I didn\\'t add a much butter a the recipe call for, only about half.  I\\'ll definitely be make noodle this way again....it\\'s so easy and delicious!  Thanks David!\\r\\n****update on 8/27/06**** since my husband\\'s heart \\'incident\\', I\\'ve have to change our cook habits.  I make this favorite recipe of ours a bite differently and it worked!  I use sodium-free, Herb Ox chicken boullion, Earth Balance \\'Buttery Sticks\\' (which be no cholesterol, non-dairy) and for the noodles, I use \\'No Yolks\\' egg noodles.  This be still terrific and I\\'m so glad we can still enjoy this recipe!  Thanks again David Ball :) A very simple and flavorful side dish that would complement many meals.  I even downsize the recipe to serve just my hubby without any problems.  Herbs would perk this up, but be not at all necessary.  I serve this with my Leeks Braised in Cream With Garlic and Lemon and Almond -Crusted Chicken Breasts.  The noodle complete a great meal.\\r\\nEDITTED TO ADD that these be a great accompaniment to <a href=\"/45975\">Crock Pot Apple and Sauerkraut Kielbasa (Low Fat)</a>. What can be say about a perfect recipe?  well let try... this recipe be absolutely the best ever. Made a couple slight changes, use 2 cup water and 3/4 stick butter. Dh go bananas. Hard time get him to realize he have eat enough.  I\\'ll make this often. Thanks david for post  The kid love this.  It be rich so you wouldn\\'t have it too often but definitely yummy. First let me say that my DH love them. Kids weren\\'t in a noodle mood and I like them.  I have a problem though because I use 12 oz. of noodle so I add a little extra water to make 2 cup but I have to stir to get all the noodle cover with water.  I think I even need more water (I cover it to let the steam help cook them too).  I use Herb Ox bouillon since there be no MSG in them.  Thanks for post and next time I\\'ll use a small bag of noodle or a wide pan!   Excellent...made with a can of Low Sodium Chicken Broth.  Served with Hamburgers/Brown Gravy (32973)and Sauteed Rutabaga (85319) Used a piece of bottom round roast that I trim and grind for the hamburgers...A reasonable low calorie meal that be so goooood David, these be great!!! Served them along side a London broil and they be a hit. Every last bite be eaten! Thank you for such an easy, quick and tasty side dish recipe!(01-12-05) UPDATE: I still make these noodle and we still love them. I do add fresh parsley with the last of the butter a couple minute before serving. Thanks David! well, i have to say i do not expect much from this base on the ingredients. wow, be i wrong !! these noodle be so very flavorful. much good than anything that come in a pack w/ a flavor pouch. trust me . this be now my go to side dish for all meat when we tire of rice and potatoes. For the calorie content I be expect something a little more exciting.  My grandmother use to make a similar dish but I don\\'t have her recipe - but it be much, much creamier.  I be expect something along those lines.  As another reviewer mentioned, it\\'s important to note the water/bouillon won\\'t completely cover the noodle and you need to stir frequently to ensure all the noodle be cooked.  I wonder if I use milk for all or part of the liquid if they would turn out even creamier? Easy and tasty! Perfect for this house! :) Thanks for a great recipe! a recipe say \"best ever\"..and it ot kidding..only thing I add be a bite of sour cream and it add that extra creamy taste that the others say be missing..thee be no way I will make plain noodle again..Thanks Great recipe, I would never guess this would work with the amount of water but it does. Next time I will adjust butter amt and maybe add some fresh herbs. This be really worth trying! Thanks for the recipe :) These noodle live up to their name! These be delicious!! I serve mine with a stew - excellent!! My husband and I help ourselves to a bowl each of them plain first though - LOL!! Gross. I think maybe it be the bouillon. I didn\\'t have that brand and maybe that be what make or break it... These be great.  I\\'ve never make butter egg noodle before, but I don\\'t think I\\'ll need any other recipe.  I use Wylers brand of bouillon and add an extra 1/2 cup of water.  With 1.5 cup water, the noodle be a little too al dente.  I might try cut back a little on the butter for health reasons, but this be definitely a keeper.  Thanks! Very good and VERY simple. A great side dish to our steak dinner. I add a touch of parsley. Thank you David Ball! I\\'ve recently come off a kick with these, make them for three day straight, heaven help my waistline... lol. use 1/2 stick butter and have add 2 spoonfulls sour cream once, a drizzle of half & half once and 1 T cream cheese all to terrific results.  I also have start boil pasta in chicken stock make from bouillion, what a great trick, give so much depth to pasta.  I\\'m converted. Thanks David! Really nice. Added 1/2 cup more water and cut the butter to 1/4 cup a suggest by others. Hi there...my husband and I get home late on Sunday and when we look in the cabinet all we have be egg noodles...so we make this!  We both love them and will be make them again.  We accidentally make this with beef bouillon but we love it.  We also take another reviewer suggestion and add a bite of cream cheese.  Wonderful! Great noodles, excessively rich and decadent, but tasty for sure!  Served with crock pot beef stroganoff (sp?)--enjoyed by all. I just love this recipe,the only thing I do be eye ball the bag of noodle I have (220z)pkg and add what I think be 8oz ...I notice that it need more water so add some.. Just make this. WOW be it lovely. IT have a nice flavor and the family love it. I add some roast garlic that I have make and boy with that addition it really set it over the top. Thanks for a great staple to my dinner Davis!!! I just saw chefhopeful\\'s review this a.m.\\r\\nand decide to try this even though I know it wouldn\\'t work..thought the amount of water would be way off..\\r\\nwas very glad I be wrong..the amount be RIGHT ON!!!\\r\\nI do stay right there and stir quite frequently a another reviewer state since the amount of water IS SO SMALL\\r\\nit come out perfect with your times\\r\\nyou stated..I use wide egg noodles\\r\\nalso another thing I\\'l like to share..I have NO bouilon cub so I think hmm what would be close\\r\\nI open a package of my ramen noodle and use the chicken flavor package & keep the noodles\\r\\nfor a future use..it work great..that be the only change I make and that be because I be to impatient to wait till I have the bouillon cubes..but it be really good...the water cook off and you be leave with a creamy very good noodle side dish..or if you be like me my lunch..Oh I DID also add a pinch of dry parsly..\\r\\nthis be a real nice way of doing\\r\\nnoodles..thanks for post this it be a real winner Buttery yumminess!  My DD (queen of carbs) love it.  Will make again. My family find these noodle to be gummy and pasty. They be flavorful, but we do not like the texture. lovely economical dish use store-cupboard ingredient that be usually on hand. easy to over-cook tho... so keep an eye on them nd remove when they still have a bite of bite a they continue to cook nd end up \\'sticky\\'. i think cook time be for dry pasta a the fresh noodle only take a minute or so. serve with parsley and parmesan. thank for an imspiring simple dish. I like butter noodle but I add dill or garlic for extra flavor. Hello David Ball, these be delicious! I use the low-sodium chicken broth and add some Parmesan cheese and chop parsley to the finish product. However, your way of cook them be the answer for the creaminess. Thank you for post a really easy and wonderful recipe, Diane :) These be wonderful and So Simple Thanks These be all right, but the butter be really too much.  After read the reviews, I think I\\'ll try it again another time and use le butter...  and maybe use some Spike or poppy seed to liven it up. Yep, best ever! Loved this recipe!  I second Diane Brooks\\' comment that the broth, water and butter mixture will not cover the noodles. One need to watch and stir requently. A package of no yolk egg noodle be 340g which translate to approx. 12oz, I increase the water to 4 cup initially and use 4 packet of OXO reduce salt chicken bouillon leave the butter a is. In the last stage I add another 1/2 cup of water with the remain butter and the noodle be DEEELISH!!! Quick and easy to put together for a side dish.  I would definitely add a little chop parsley on top to make it look great.  Thanks for an easy recipe I can put together to finish off my meal to perfection! This be really quick and delicious. Thank you for sharing. What more can I say than have already be said?  These noodle be real comfort food.  Each noodle be pack with flavor.  Thanks. Very easy and the whole family love it.  Will surely be add this to our menu! Very tasty and simple recipe. I use fettucine and two vegetable stock cubes. Started with 2 cup of water, and have to top up twice during cooking. I\\'d plan on use le butter but make a mistake convert and use the full amount, so it become a bite rich about half way through eat it. Next time I\\'d use reduce salt stock a I find myself drink water all night.  As note by other reviewers: stir often. I think these noodle be just ok. They be a bite too salty for my taste. Really yummy. Everyone like them.  I will be make these again.  Thanks you for post it. These be delicious!  Only change I make be to add an extra 1/2 cup of water.  I try a low fat version of this recipe, use no yolk egg noodle and 1 stick of margarine instead of the butter and it turn out great.  Not quite a flavorful a the original recipe, but the family still eat \\'em all up! My family gobble this up. Next time I would double the recipe, because it be not enough for a main dish. It be easy to make & have a ton of flavor. Next time I might cut down a little on the butter & use 1 or 1 1/2 bouillon cubes, because it be a little salty for our taste. So good, can\\'t wait to make it again. YUM! Really simple to make, and I just know my kid be gonna love them..thanks for sharing! These be unbelievable. And you don\\'t need to drain them! The trick be to stand over them and stir the pot frequently. At the end it boil down and they become so creamy and deeeeelightful! Thanks for this one! Oh my these be good.  So simple yet so tasty. Thank you for posting....Stephanie Absolutely delicious. Did have to add quite a bite more water and would decrease the amt. of butter next time because we find it too greasy. Served this with recipe#37413 and recipe#84665 These be really good and easy to make. I make these exactly a written. The next time I make these, the only thing I would do different be to make a double batch :) Everyone eat these up and there be nothing left. They be so much good then package butter noodles. Loved them. I use the boullion and only 1/2 cup butter a suggested. I use chicken base in place of the bouillon cubes.  Excellent with the addition of some freshly crack pepper!  Thank you. So delicious and very creamy! The kid and husband love it! Thanks These be very flavorful!  I use 1 can of chicken broth and add 1 can of water, use margarine instead of butter, some parsley for color.  The flavor be 10 time good than just use water to boil. Very good recipe, I use tortilli and more water with the chicken bullion a previous poster noted.  I also add some garlic powder before serve them with some parmesan cheese.  Thank you for the great and easy recipe. After read some of the other review I decide to add more water than be list here. End result be yuummmyy! This be so simple to make and have great results! this be a simple addition to my swedish meatball dinner. This be a must add. Obviously, this doesn\\'t need another review, but what the hey...  These noddled be groovy.  My new word for 2008...lol!  It be such an innovative way to make butter noodles, and the fam love them.  I, too, only use 1/2 stick butter (total), use a little extra water, and at the end add crack black pepper and garlic powder.  Remember folks....stir, stir, stir....have to keep those noddle move while they\\'re cooking.  I think maybe next time I\\'ll try a butter substitute just to make it a bite healthier.  This be now save in my \"tried and true\" folder.  Thanks so much for a winner! I give this recipe 4 stars. My family really like these noodles. My 3 & 5 yr old newphews woofed them right down and ask for seconds. The only problem I have with the recipe be the sauce never thicken with 8oz of noodles, so after they cook I remove them add 8oz more of noodle and 1/4 cup more water and cook the noodle until tender and pour the sauce over all the noodles. Next time I will start with the 16oz of noodles. Overall these be so good and we will have these again for sure. Thank you so much for post a yummy recipe. Christine (internetnut) The family love it!  I add fresh parsley and have to use a little more water a I cook it.  Thank you! Good, but I\\'d cut the butter down next time. These be suprisingly good!!! Who\\'d a think there\\'d be a technique to prepare butter noodles. Both of my kid eat these up and ask for second which really say something because the young eat nothing!! I do increase the water and cut down on the butter a tad due to response from other readers. This be a definite keeper, thanx David!! Uh, helloooo!! This be AMAZING! I do add about 2 cup of water a I could immediately tell the 1 1/2 cup would not be enough to cover the noodles. I then add about a spoonful of butter and one more bullion cube. I saw that it didn\\'t need any butter at the end, it be just too goood! For those think about make this it\\'s basically one of those recipe you just figure out a you go.  The amount of water, butter and even bullion be totally up to you.  More noddles, more of the other ingredients!  But if you make close to 8 oz then 2 1/2-3 1/2 cup of water should do the job.  Thanks so much for sharing! This be a keeper!!! Nice flavor, but I have problem with the water evaporating.  I also have to cook a lot long then expected. Really really great!!!  I do add a little bite of parsley and a couple shake of parmesian cheese, but otherwise I follow the direction exactly.  I would say that with my family of 3 boy (DH included), this be not enough for 4 servings, but since I have to watch my weight and try to stay away from pasta and butter, it be the perfect amount.  My boy devour it.  Thanks David, for this awsome recipe!!! YUMMY!  These be delicous.  Instead of real butter I mostly use light margarine.  It turn out great!  I addded lot of salt, pepper, and parsley to flavor it nicely.  At the end of cook I do add 2 tbs. of real butter along with the light margarine.  This need to be frequently stir since the water doesnt completely cover.  Also cover your pot while it boil will give an extra hand on steam those top noodle that arent under the water.  After the 6-8 minute it be perfectly cook and all the liquid be suck right up into those noodles.  Im glad I find this recipe!  I will be make it all the time! Great way to cook noodles! Amazing full body flavor. I use only 3/4 of a stick of butter and it be plenty for our tastes. I add some freshly chop parsley, too. I put a lid askew on the pot , too. ...  and lift the lid to frequently stir the noodle so they would cook evenly. It realy be the best ever!!!  Used 1/2 unsalted butter & 1/2 butter supstitute and be wonderful Awesome Fast! Easy! Delicious!!!\\nComparable to one of those pre-packaged noodle sides.  Doubles and triple easily. This be a easy 5 Star for me. I love pasta and butter and the chicken boullion be a for sure the best seasoning. I have everything on hand and be want something to eat. This be just a easy and fast a my hunger could take. Thank You for a fast easy snack. Hugs I make this last night for dinner.  I have to make a second batch.  My family love it.  Thank you for the recipe. This be pretty good! It do remind me of something you would get from one of those lipton side dish though, but still good! These be the best ever!  I have to make more in the middle of dinner because we run out!  Loved them.  Thanks for the great recipe. Nice side dish.  I use \"Better than Bullion\" and it kinda come out like a cheese sauce on the noodles. This be a perfect recipe! Delicious! I have use a little a 1-2 TBSP and have have good results, if you be concern about fat or just don\\'t want to use a much butter This a simple but tasty side dish to fall back on time and again. Thank you. Very nice. I use half low sodium broth and half bullion because I (and this be personal thing obviously) find bullion too salty even in small doses. Came out great. Def. something I will be make again. This be so good. I know my family will be ask for this again. I make it a state but add a can of chicken broth and use the whole 12 ounce package of egg noodle along with a little extra butter. Yum. YUMMY.  I love these.  Used vegetable broth, but be still really good.  I will be make this again!!!! Thanks so much for the recipe. These be so good and so easy.  I also cut the butter in half and have to use 1 can of chicken broth because that be what I have on hand.  I also add an extra 1/2 cup of water toward the end to cook to how I like them.  I add fresh crack pepper and a little dill and some freeze peas.  It be so yummy, I can\\'t wait to make them again. Quick and easy .made 1/2 receipe, use a sidedish. Added a little Garlic Salt for add flavor.  DH add Parmesan cheese for add flavor. I\\'m sorry.  I make these (admitedly with half the butter a others have do and have success with) but I be quite disappoint with the results. I do have to continue to add more water to keep them from scorch too. They be just to pasty for my palate.  Won\\'t be do them again. Awesome taste - simplicity itself!  I *think* what be a problem for others be easily correct - I bring butter/water/boullion to boil, throw in noodles, turn heat to low possible simmer. and PUT A LID ON THE POT!  That\\'s it - just stir once or twice b4 throw the rest of the butter on - GREAT!!! wow.....yummy. at first i think there wasnt enough water used. so i add 2 cup of water and it turn out perfect cook for 6 min. i add some sausage link and my kid 1 and 2 yr old eat it with no problems. thank for sharing. WOW, so simple and perfect for DGSs, it\\'s so rare to find something they really like and both will eat and they both ask for second with this.  A testament to it earn 10 stars.  I follow the direction exactly and use whole wheat noodle so even get some fiber into them.  Served with a hotdog and steam broccoli and it be such a hit it be go before I could get a picture.  But I will be do this again and will make sure I do get one and post it then.\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks David for make this Nanna look good to her DGSs I typically don\\'t rate the super easy/simple recipes....but this one be very good.  I double the recipe and it turn out soooo creamy and flavorful.   I make a pot roast to go along with this recipe.  I typically put the roast gravy over the noodles, but the noodle be so good that I didn\\'t want to cover their taste with gravy! There be not enough water in this recipe, I do a instruct and continually stirred, but the noodle be crunchy even after heat long then indicated.  I won\\'t make this again, but would suggest if you be go to try this recipe to cook the noodle with the bullion and then add butter at the end.  I also notice that it seem there be too much butter a there be quite a bite of butter residue during clean up. Even add more water, this just didn\\'t work for me. After stir the noodle try to get them cooked, some be a bite shredded. As the dish cool a bit, it turn into a firm lump of noodles. I don\\'t mind some extra butter here and there, but the amount in this dish wasn\\'t justify in the result. Next time I\\'ll boil the noodles, drain, and add some butter. Thanks for share the recipe. I love this dish! I just try it for the first time and it\\'s dynamite! I do use some of the suggestion though. With a full 16oz bag I use 2 can of broth (low sodium, 14.5oz each) and 4oz water. 3/4 cup of butter, 1 teaspoon kosher salt. 1 teaspoon fresh black pepper, 1/4 fresh chop parsley. I stir often and leave it cover until the last 2 minutes. It come out nice and tender with a good sauce. Excellent!!  As personal preference, I use \\'No Yolk Dumpling noodles\\' . . delicious! Easy and fast. Kid friendly, which be always a bonus around here. Budget friendly, too. Thanks for post :) I start cook this a direct only to find myself add more water.  Then it seem a bite too buttery so I add even more pasta.  The end product be a very quick and kid-friendly dish.  Will make again but with le butter.  Thanks for posting. Ohhh, my arteries!!\\nGreat easy dish, wonderful taste but can\\'t see myself make it very often. Good! Made this a a side for recipe #37413.  I use beef bouillon instead and it be an excellent match.  I do make a note to use only half the butter call for a recommend by other reviewer but end up use the 1/2 cup it call for.  IMPORTAT NOTE: stir, stir, stir!!!  It will look like there be not nearly enough water but the noodle will come out great a long a you stir CONSTANTLY.  Thanks forthe recipe! This be super good.  I\\'ve never make flavor noodle before.  I do use only 1/4 cup butter and be still really good. Very good!! Loved this simple\\r\\nbut delicious recipe. Would not change a thing!! This be great! So much good than the box butter noodles! Very easy to make! This be so easy and very tasty.  I use 3 c chicken broth and end up add an extra cup of water at the end because the noodle weren\\'t quite do and they be stick to the bottom of the pan.  I also use 12 oz whole wheat egg noodles.  At the end, I turn the heat off, add some fresh grate Parmesan cheese, and put the lid on for a few minutes.  The family devour it.  I will make again. Excellent! Just like my grandmother use to make!! My husband saw butter noodle and immediately bring out the spaghetti sauce. I tell him he good try it before he put that all over. He end up leave the red sauce off. The kid eat all their noodles, too. They be really good. I end up use spaghetti noodle and add a little more water. They turn out great. Thanks. My family love these noodle and they eat lot of noodles!  I find that if I want to make a whole 12 oz. pkg it work great with 3 cups. of liquid.  I make them in a big, wide pan so that there be lot of surface area.  I use 2 cup of chicken stock, 1 cup water, 3 tsps. chicken granules, and 1/2 stick of butter.\\nThanks for posting! Good noodle but I think that the direction be lack a bit.  Even a a pretty experience cook I be ready to prepare these in a tall, burner sized, metal saucepan.  Thank goodness I read some review first to realize that this need to be make in a shallow, large bottom pan such a a non-stick skillet (which be what I end up using).  The taste deliver what I expect but to take it up a notch I snip fresh parsley and parmesan cheese over the top before serving. Amazingly simple, incredibly tasty!! We enjoy these wonderful noodle for supper tonight with roast chicken slice over top and fresh green bean from our garden, yummmmm.\\r\\nBased on other review I up the liquid by about a 1/4 cup and that be perfect.\\r\\nThanks for sharing! It\\'s a great side dish for most meals.  I start off with 3 c. water, 4 bouillon cubes, and a 12 oz. pack of yolk-free egg noodles.  I use all the butter a directed.  I end up at a bite more water a the noodle start to stick and another bouillon cube a well.  I also sprinkle a liberal amount of basil and black pepper on when I be finished. We love this- find it to be a easy,or easier, than a box mix. Thanks so much! A very easy side dish. Made it with a Pot Roast (http://www.food.com/recipe/easy-crock-pot-roast-32215 ) and it be fantastic together! I use 3/4 of the butter the recipe call for and a little olive oil. Added a tad of Italian seasoning, red pepper flakes, and a little parm.  Great, will use again! I can\\'t believe I never rat this, it\\'s be a staple since I first try it. I use a 16 oz bag of egg noodles, up the water to 3 1/2 cups, keep the butter at 1 stick, and I use 1 T chicken base rather than bullion cubes. After add the noodle I cover the pot with a lid and reduce the heat to med-low. Everyone gobble this up. Thanks for a great easy recipe! YUMMY... I do cover it like someone recommend and I have to add more water to get it all cooked, but a long a I know what I need to do... it\\'s a keeper for sure! Great easy side dish, I will use a bite le butter next time-but a keeper! I LOVED THIS RECIPE!  I too make a pot roast and it go perfect with it! I have almost nothing in the pantry when I find this recipe! But I have these ingredients, and then add 2 can of chunk white chicken. It be delicious! A very satisfy meal indeed, serve with a green salad. Like many others, I add 1/2 c water, use a wide bottom pan, and cover it. I do have to uncover and stir frequently. A definite shoestring budget keeper! This be quick and easy.  I only use 1/4 cup of butter. Very tasty.  I get unsolicited compliment on it from the husband and he even ask about ingredient in it and get seconds.  I just wish I could sprinkle something on it so it would look more like it have a sauce.  I saw that others put parsley, basil or black pepper.  I might try those for visual appeal.  The flavor be good without them though.  I\\'d add a third bouillon cube because I like the flavor & I about halve the butter because the amount seem like a lot, but the flavor be still good. Made this recipe with a full 16oz bag of Egg Noodles, 3.5 cup of water and two packet of Herb-OX sodium free chicken powder. Added a fistfull of dry parsley and a bunch of fresh crack black pepper. The wife and I love it. Next time, I will use more of the Chicken powder. Went very well with meatloaf recipe: http://www.food.com/recipe/meatloaf-15027 and some Steamed green beans. We really enjoy these last night.Egg noodle be our favorite.I sometimes boil them up and add a can of cream of chicken soup and some butter but I be diet so that be out.For these I add some promise margerine and they be good.I also throw in a few chop onions.Simple and good recipe.Thank you! These noodle be awesome!!!  Too bad they\\'re not low fat :(  Oh well, five star recipe! My 8yo and 2yo gobble this up. Was a super quick and easy dish to make when we be in a rush to get something in their bellies. Thanks! Savory indeed. I use Beef Boullion instead of chicken, add some parsley, garlic powder, and oregano. Also add extra water and butter. And mix in some pea for add veggies. Definitely go to be use this recipe more often! This recipe be a staple in our house! Very easy and very good. These always disappear! We use half the butter and I usually accidentally put it all in at first, then just stir and cook until all that\\'s leave be a yummy glaze on the noodles. I didn\\'t know I could be so impress with butter noodles!  They be quick, delicious, and perfect for a cold winter even full of studying.  I add a little grate Parmesan before serving: De-licious! I also increase the amount of water but I also increase the butter and chicken bouillan a well. These noodle be delicious. I make my own vegetable stock with scrap I freeze so I always have plenty in the fridge. I like to use stock versus bouillon because it be le salty, but that be just my preference. We also like to add a generous amount of fresh grind black pepper to the butter egg noodles.. YUM! Easy and yummy!  After read reviews...I halve the butter. Used 3.5 cup water for whole bag of noodles.  Added some garlic powder and parsley for a little umphh.  I will be make these again! Wonderful noodles.  We really enjoy the egg noodle prepare this way.  Made a write but decrease the amount of butter used. Lovely noodles, buttery, creamy and delicious, full of flavor.  Served with Down East Oven Scallops and Roasted Sugar Snap Peas for a memorable meal.  Thank you so much for share this simple and easy to make treasure. I have a great try What&#039;s not to like? Fat + carbs = cheap, hedonistic, late night goodness The flavor be far good than I expected. I follow others advice and make in a shallow pan, cover the noodle so a to conserve water, but still find that I need to add an additional 1/4 c of water to cook them to my desire level of doneness. I initially use 2 tsp of chicken bouillon, but end up double that to around 4 tsp to suit my preferences. Threw in 1/4 c of parsley for color. My fiance add parmesan to his, but we both agree they be great a is. Made this for the first time last night. I use the &quot;no yolks&quot; brand of noodle in the extra broad size. I have to add 2 cup of water for the big noodle. My kid be so amaze at the taste. Not sure why it be so much good than when we cook it and add butter later, but it sure is. YUM! The recipe a write isn&#039;t perfect but it&#039;s a great start!! The only thing I change be double the water and put all of the butter in before the noodles. The sauce be wonderful! Delicious. I make this last night, to go with smoke Turkey breast.  It be delicious!  Instead of egg noodle I use my homemade thin linguine noodle and I&#039;ve also make this with my homemade spinach pasta , absolutely delicious. I can&#039;t wait to make it again. My husband couldn&#039;t get enough of them. It&#039;s amaze how something so simple can be so comforting.  Thanks for a great recipe. I have a 12oz package of noodles, so I adjust the water accordingly and add a bite more bullion. At first, the water didn&#039;t cover the noodle and I be worried, but I keep move the pasta around and it be fine. I find make any pasta and basic sauce simple, but this be soooooo easy! I\\'ve make this many times, but this time I try it in my rice cooker with success. I do give it a stir a few time while cooking. When the water/bouillon be gone, I switch it to warm, add some more butter and some parmesan, put the lid back on and leave it on warm for a few minutes. I do use le butter, and add some fresh basil. I will make it this way again. Such a great, easy side! Wasn\\'t use to cook egg noodle like this and definitely find other reviewer suggestion helpful and make sure to read recipe through twice. Used 2 cup of water and a large shallow metal pan. I use one Knorr cube which be I think large than most other bouillon cubes. Stirred the whole time a another reviewer suggested, the noodle really do cook through all the way. These noodle be soooo good for so little effort! Thank you, gonna make some more of these asap! Extremely greasy, too much butter. Thumbs down. I didn\\'t have all the ingredient for an intend side dish one night. I search the internet for a quick side that contain ingredient on hand. I luckily find this one. Little effort couple with awesome result be my kind of recipe. I do follow other reviewers\\' recommendation and use le butter (1/4c total). Still a tad on the greasy side so probably could back off a little more. Do stir, stir, stir a state in other reviews. Very tasty dish that will be make again at my house. I change this up a tad, I need beefy noodle to compliment my beef, onion and pepper so I substitute beef broth, increase the broth to 3 cups, use 2/3 cup butter divide and 12 ounce of wide egg noodles! BAM!! Awesome!! Great new way forme to cook egg noodles, I\\'ll never boil them again!!! Delicious! Did not tweak but next time I will increase the water to 2 cups. I didn\\'t want too much butter so I tweak the recipe by use 2c water and 1/4c butter and it turn out perfectly. I also use a shallow pan a suggest by some reviews. they be really good I make this use milk instead of water. Then once the noodle be still a little firm I add a can of Italian dice tomato with juice, a little lemon juice, sweet peas, and crumble bacon. I let it simmer a little long then top it with shred Parmesan. Soooooo good! These be so good, but I definitely have to tweak it. I don’t know how you can boil that amount of noodle in such a small amount of water, even when doubling. So I put a quart and a half of water, 3 buillion cub (the big ones) and 1/2 a stick of butter in the water, add the rest of the butter at the end. They be amazing! I splurge and add parmesan, some cook liquid and parsley. m...m Who know that use bouillon would taste so so so much better! I actually do not. Thank you so much for this recipe! Such an underrate side dish. Needs a bite more water though! Add another half cup at least.',\n",
       " \" A gem of a recipe! There's nothing not to love about these meatballs. The flavour be incredible, the texture be soft and moist, and the aroma be out of this world. I use a bite of red onion instead of a shallot and shred cheese instead of the finely grate cheese. I bake the meatball on a sprayed, foil-lined bake sheet for 20 minute at 400 degrees. Perfect! This be the kind of recipe I'd double next time to have extra to freeze. Thanks for a keeper, JoJoStar! I be very happy with the result of these meatballs. I be actually try to find a lose recipe of mine for meatball and this one seem to be the close match. Thank you very much for posting, they be really awesome!\",\n",
       " ' These be delicious! I sub half-and-half for the cream and add extra shrimp (I chop it in the food processor and use about 3/4 cup). Two large ear of corn yield exactly 2 cup of kernels.

       " \" These remind me of chocolate crinkle cookies, except they flatten out a little more.  I love that this recipe be gluten free and so easy to make.  I use Dutch process cocoa, homemade vanilla, and a small cookie scoop (2 teaspoons)  to make 23 cookies.  They bake for 13 minutes, and the end result be both crispy and chewy, so I think they'll satisfy both kind of cookie lovers.  The dark chocolate be a little too dark for my taste, but I know just who to bake these for come the holidays!  :)  Thanks for another great recipe, pastawendy!  Made & enjoy for the Fall 2012 Pick-A-Chef event. These be amaze and no one know they be flourless they be the first cooky eat at the cookie party I go to.  Thanks for share definitely make these again! Incredible! No one would guess these be grain- and gluten-free. I place the roll cooky in the freezer until firm before bake them, this keep them from spread too much. Hi hop to make for a healthy pot luck. Recipe call for grind almond be that the same a almond flour or can I use almond flour it be the only thing I have available in our remote area? These be fabulous and easy to make. I couldn't find grind almond, nor do I know if I could substitute almond flour, so I put sliver almond into a ziplock bag and pound them with a hammer until I have grind almond! I just make theses, very good! I'm no expert, but I use grind almonds, and think grind almond be just that, ground, but not powder; they be a more smal,l crush &amp; courser consistency, and didn't make the cookie a dense I believe, a oppose to use the almond flour. The almond flour be a small particle powdery consistency, so I'm sure it would change the texture of the cookie entirely, but not the taste, and they still both be the same thing, almonds.\",\n",
       " ' A really terrific recipe.  We have fresh corn which really add to the taste.

Thank you Valerie for share this.   :-)\\r\\n This be good-very cheesey with our very sharp vintage cheddar in it. We only heat it for half the time a we want it warm and soften not runny like fondue a we plan to rip the bread apart a we ate. I figure cook for 1 1/2 hour would result in quite runny cheese. Our cheese be very strong, and a good slug of Tabasco would have counteract that. My family go crazy over this. I make 4 batch between Christmas and New Years in 2003.  I expect to do the same this year. Wow!  This be super easy and really tasty.  My very picky family eat it all almost a soon a I serve it.  Thanks for share this! Delicious!  I make the recipe even easy by use a bottle of real bacon piece (in the salad aisle) and a bag of shred cheese.  I use slice pumpernickel bread.  I bake the dip in a dish instead of in a bread bowl.  I only bake it long enough to get warm.  I don't think it need 1.5 hours.  It be a hit with everyone!! I make this for a party and it be a huge hit.  I make two of them and in one I add chop fresh broccoli, it be delicious. I do bake them for the full 1 1/2 hour a instructed. I make this bread dip for a Christmas party and now this be my assign dish every year.  Everyone love it.  The only difference be I also add a small bite of mince garlic and a few cheese blend include asiago and romano with the cheddar.  Great and easy to make. make this for football sunday... wonderfull!!! Everyone rave about it and be give strict order to bring for every game. Best of all, so easy to make!! Everybody love this when I make it. When there be any left, we like to roll it up in tortilla and slice them to make spiral snacks.\",\n",
       " \" Delicious!  My husband and I enjoy this soup the other evening, and then save the rest in the freezer for another night.  I use all organic ingredient (including organic free-range chicken broth), and the color, taste, and aroma be all wonderful.  Although we have this soup a a main course (very filling), it would also make an excellent first course with company.  And I be surprise at how easy it be to make!  Thank you! This be the most AMAZING soup I've ever had.  Everything about it be decadent.  The ginger and cilantro add a sweet aroma to the soup.  I use sweet onion and lemon pepper instead of the crush red pepper.  I seriously recommend this recipe to any carrot fan out there. I make this the other day for lunch. I love this recipe. It be easy to make a well. I do not have fresh ginger so I use 1 tsp of grind ginger and 1/8 tsp of red pepper flakes. Thanks for a delicious soup recipe. I just finish make this and it's incredibly good! The only thing I change be to use Vegetarian Vegetable Broth instead of Chicken Broth, to suit my dietary needs. Excellent soup a well a fit in with my Weight Watchers Core Plan. Thanks so much! Very nice - simple to make and low fat - i go a bite over board on the coriander but still be nice - i use veg stock add a bite of lemongrass and an extra onion - would make again!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks  Nice change of pace.  Very good when you have a cold!  Easy to make, and it do freeze/thaw well.  My vegetarian neighbor love it(she doesn't know about the ch****en broth).  I have a cold right now, and if I didn't have dinner plans, I'd make it again tonight.  Thanks, Dancer. This be soooooooo good!!!! I use vegetable broth and add quite a bite of red pepper flakes. I also add about 1 teaspoon or more of hot sauce. I let this set together for a couple of hour in the fridge, and then reheated. GREAT! very, very good. i make it too hot and spicy for the kids, but my husband and myself we love the soup. I just make this but improvise due to lack of certain ingredients. I have no cilantro, so I add about 1/2 tsp of dry crush mint and have no fresh ginger, so add about a tsp of grind ginger. I also add extra cayanne, a tsp of sesame oil (toward the end), about a tbsp of tumeric, 1/4 to 1/2 tsp of coriander, about 1 tbsp salt (to taste... have no broth!), about 1 tsp of cane sugar.\\nAlso, I only cook the carrot mixture in 2 cup of water (instead of 3) and then once transfer to the blender, I add about 1 1/2 - 2 cup of skim milk... to desire consistency. \\nIt turn out super spicy and super delicious!! My version be definitely Indian inspire though, a oppose to Thai. \\nMy husband scarf 2 bowl down! He usually doesn't even like carrot soup... but we both LOVED this!!! Nice different twist to the classic carrot soup. I also add some celery and cook potato.\\n\\nThanks What a great taste dish.  It be very aromatic and great balance of flavors.  Nice and spicy.  I be search for a soup to go with a spinach salad and this be right on the money.  Thanks for share this wonderful recipe.  I save it in my try and true cookbook. Delicious! I add a stick of celery and use mince garlic 1 tbsp and mince ginger 2 tbsp. I add the juice of one orange and accidentally use 3 tablespoon of oil instead of 1. I blend the coriander in whole and freash and didn't reheat it - it be fantastic! I use this recipe a a guide, but didn&#039;t follow it very carefully because I think the direction about how to blend it be unnecessarily complicated. HOWEVER, I neglect to notice that the carrot be suppose to simmer covered, so when it come time for say blending, the result product come out like what I can only call &quot;whipped carrots.&quot; The flavor be INCREDIBLE! It be so good that I be go to make it again the same way to serve the carrot a a side dish to my turkey for Christmas. I&#039;m sure make a state it would be a wonderful soup, but I may never try it that way!\",\n",

These meatball be like a cross between a Swedish meatball and a beef stroganoff. They're very easy to put together the night before and pop into the oven the next night. Next time I make these, I plan to add a little black pepper to the meatball and a little nutmeg to the sauce.\\nSince I make the meatball a little bigger, I bake them another 15 minute and they be tender but firm.\\nA great inexpensive meal for a cold rainy night.

I couldnt find a cubanelle pepper so I use a yellow bell pepper, vegetable broth, and omit the chop basil leaves. I think this would be great with regular pasta if you dont care for whole wheat but we do enjoy the change of pace. Definitely add the extra cheese after serving. Thank you Lainey for a great meal! Made and review for the Special Ingredient Tag Game. Very delicious and fast! I will definitely make this again! My boyfriend be vegetarian and it be hard to find recipe use ingredient I have around the house.\\n\\nI also couldn't find a cubanelle pepper, so I use an orange pepper. I use everything else though! The basil leave make for great presentation; I slice one huge one for each serving, and top it with a little more cheese.\\n\\nMy only complaint be that the sauce be too runny for my tastes. I add some cornstarch mix in with cold broth in the last minute. There be still a lot of sauce at the bottom of my bowls; it be a good thing we have bread to sop up all that deliciousness!\",\n",

       " \" This be very easy to prepare and taste pretty good. I think the poach liquid which I use a a sauce over the fish when serve be a little too rich taste and didn't compliment the delicate taste of the fish. I probably won't make this again. I live near Baltimore and this be a very simple tasty way to prepare and poach fish.  The fish be perfect and the milk and Old Bay be a perfect compliment to a mild fish.  I love this poach method!  The Old Bay be so good a a seasoning!  I love it! My DH like this but I didn't feel the poach method go well with this particular fish, Basa.  Although I do like the flavour of the old bay and the little bite it gives, but didn't like the texture of fish.  I guess I prefer Basa coat and grilled.

The family love these cooky and they be much good than the store buy ginger snaps. Thanks for sharing! I have be try to find a good recipy for ginger cooky forever. This one be it. They come out extemely well. Don\\'t double this! It be too much for my kitchen-aid! I make 128 cooky from this by make them half inch ball of dough and reduce the bake time to nine minutes.

We start give them out to all of the relative and they all now want the recipe! Thank you so much. This be our new favorite cookie!! I love these cookies.  Ginger have always be my favorite cookie, and this have become my top of the list cookie.  Thnx for post this wonderful recipe. Delicious, chewy cookies. I roll them in demerrara sugar, so the crystal be nice and big. I double the recipe, and I have some of the dough in the fridge so I can just whip up some cooky whenever the occasion warrant it! I do find that the dough behave much good if it be cold when work with, otherwise it be way too sticky to roll. Thanks for a great ginger cookie that be *not* crunchy! I don\\'t know how you get only 35 cooky out of this recipe, if you roll them 1\".  I cut the recipe in half, and still get 64 cookies.  I up the ginger some, but overall a delicious cookie - it\\'s become a family favorite! I have make these delicious, chewy cooky several times. Also love add chop crystalize ginger to the recipe. I be get ready to make these again for Christmas. Thanks again Sharon. The best ginger cooky I have ever baked!! I try this recipe and it be like eat candy, way too much sugar. Don\\'t double this like it says, it make a ton and I suspect it have already be doubled.  Any more and the Kitchen Aid couldn\\'t have mix them.  Just what I be look for--very sweet, but very god and lovely crinkly tops. These have a lovely texture (and taste good too)!  I make half a recipe and after try the first one out opt to not roll any more in sugar.',\n",
       " ' So easy and so delicious! I halve the butter because it seem like too much. This be wonderful serve warm with ice cream! I make this cake for Chef I Am\\'s Cake-A-Thon and it didnt work to well for me. Layered the ingredient in the order list but for some reason my cake only start bake where the melt butter was. After about 45 minute I take it out of the oven and fold some of the uncooked cake mix in with the cooked. This help but the cake still do not bake all the way. My end result be a loose fudge type brownie cake, the coconut be crunchy, but it do have a very good flavor with the cherry and pineapple. Will make this again soon and try to fiqure out what I do wrong. We love pineapple and coconut in nearly anything, but be disappoint by this cake.  It didn\\'t moisten up througout and the coconut texture be a bite unpleasant for u somehow.  Would love to find a way to make these flavor work and may try to alter this in the future to work for us. I be a cook for a Hospice facility and make dump cake quite a bite a they always go over.  I use the peach pie filling, crush pineapple in it own juice, white cake mix and finely chop mac nuts.  I never add coconut a it dry up.  My recipe originally come from the Cake Doctor series and I use 1.5 stick of butter, thinly slice (NOT MELTED) and place over entire surface of cake mix.  Not for every day but boy howdy, this one always disappear before I come in the next day. This be a great taste cake.\\r\\nThe only thing I do be put the nut on the last half of cook time. YUMMM! :-) I have make many Dump Cakes, but this be \"THE BEST\". Never think of use lemon pie filling! We love anything Lemon. Thanks for post this great dessert. Everyone go home with the recipe.The store around will wonder what\\'s go on? :-) Ingrid\\r\\nPs: I make it again! This time I combine the Lemon Pie filling, Coconut and pineapple. It be easy to get it even! I also add some lemon zest. We be gonig to get fat on this.It be ssooo God! :-) Koechin This be the recipe I use from a church cookbook however, my recipe do not call for the walnuts.  I will be sure to try that next time. It be so incredibly easy and delicious.  Thanks for posting. Have not try it, but it sound wonderful and oh so easy.  Will be sure to try it soon. This be excellent, especially warm.  Easy to make.  It lose a star because a lot of the cake mix wasn\\'t be bake (it be just stay the dry mix), so I end up have to pour a little water over the dry spot so it would bake, but that work like a charm and 4 people eat a half a pan in one night! Just make this today, and my hubby be practically kiss my feet! SO DELICIOUS!!! I even omit the coconut and nuts, but it be still to-die-for yummy. Couldn\\'t be easy to make, either. A solid five stars.',\n",

The parsley cook down into yecky, slimy string and I have to go through and pick them all out.  The second time I use chop fresh parsley. Much good and look nice.  The second time I use regular onion and it be just a wonderful.  It be a great dinner party meal. Tie the fresh parsley, thyme and bay leaf in cheese cloth for the cook portion of the herbs.  Do not tie them loose together without cheesecloth or, a DonnaMarie stated, they will be mush and flavor the stew differently.',\n",

Thanks AuntSana! :) This be delicious! I make this the night before.  I have never stuff manicotti before and use a butter knife.  It seem to work resonably well. It would probably be easy to mix spice with beef before add beans. I use spicy refried beans. I wasn't sure if I should add the picante/water mix the night before, so I wait until just before cook and it turn out great.  Thanks for sharing!\",\n",

This be now my new favorite cucumber salad.  The blend of flavor be just fabulous, and the texture be great -- very crunchy.  Thanks so much for post this! We make this once at least once a week.  If I cannot find red chili pepper, I use red pepper flakes. Leftovers be great for lunch and easy to pack than salad with dress on the side. This be definately the best thing that can be do with cucumbers. Next time I will add more chili. I use shallot instead of scallion and a mix of tarragon, oregano and rosemary in the absence of basil. Still love it. Nice refeshing strong flavor. This be definitely the best cucumber salad recipe I've ever come across -- the strong flavor be a perfect combination of sweet, tart and spicy!  I keep the skin on for extra nutrient and it turn out well, although if you do the same, you should make sure you taste the skin first for bitterness (and buy organic).  I substitute lime with lemon juice because that's what I have on hand and it turn out well. YUM!  I use 1 cucumber and then cut the marinade in half.  It be delicious after sit for only about 30 minutes.  I will certainly make this again. Perfect for the Thai Turkey dish a a side.  It&#039;s just the two of u so I use 1 cucumber and cut the marinade in half just like JanuaryBride.  I also substitued lemon juice since I didn&#039;t have lime and it be very good.  I didn&#039;t have fresh or whole dry red chilli pepper so I use red pepper flake for the heat.  I will keep this recipe on hand and make it again.\",\n",

I have to keep go over the ingredient to make sure I have include everything and then some I couldn't find when they be suppose to be added.  So, while I simmer the tomatoes, I saute the green onions, peppers, and carrot sin some olive oil.  When it say to add the spices, I assume that mean garlic and parsley with the bouillon?  I also add a generous handful of Cajun seasoning.  After add the cabbage, mushrooms, zucchini, and V8, I realize the celery never go in, so I add it then.  I also realize I didn't add the jalapeno peppers, which be probably include in step 4, so I add them then a well.  I do end up add some vegetable broth a it cook because it need a little more liquid for my tastes.  The end result be very delicious!  I love cabbage soup, and this one be one of the best.

Thanks, Cher... this one be go into the \"special dinners\" file. :o) Cher, this be delicious!!!  The only change I make be I slightly pound the thick part of the chicken and I add salt to the marinade.  I LOVE spinach, and the sauce and the spinach be perfect with the chicken! On top of the pasta (I use Westbrae Angel Hair Pasta for gluten-free) it look scrumptious!  If I know how to post a picture, I would have. :) Wonderful!  The only thing I will change next time be to use more fresh spinach.  One cup be not nearly enough, should be 4 cups.  I marinate the breast for only 7 hours, but it be very tasty and the marinade be a perfect blend of just the right amount of spice in the oil.  The whole house smell great! Never think my husband would even try this dish. But boy be I wrong. He enjoy this dish so much. Thanks for posting. I only marinate the chicken for 1 hour. Instead of finish cook the chicken in the oven, I put it back in the pan after the spinach wilted, there be plenty of liquid to submerge the chicken. I serve it over rice because that\\'s what we be in the mood for.  Sauce be more like a soup then rich and creamy. Very good and a very pretty dish. I use a lot more spinach (11 oz.). Perhaps because I use so much spinach, the result sauce be thin than I wanted, so I push the wilt spinach to one side in the pan & use some corn starch to thicken it; flour should work also. As I write this, I\\'m think some slice mushroom might be really good cook with the spinach in that white sauce. We have this for supper tonight and it be great.  I do make a few changes.  I add 4 cup of spinach, a small package of slice mushroom, 1/2 white wine and 1/2 cup madeira wine.  I think it turn out fabulous. Thanks for posting! What a delicious way to fee my family spinach!

I cover it again and leave the house for 3 hours! I come back, run the mixer for about 15 minute and let rise again for almost and hour (in the mixer). Finally, I shape the rolls, let rest for about 30 minute then baked. The roll be perfect! These be ok but I would have prefer le of a whole wheat taste (I do use 1 cup of all-purpose flour but would use more in the future). Also, I find these do not rise very quickly.

Absolutely delicious and devour with olive and a slice of fresh toast for supper last night! I use ALL of the ingredient and I cannot wait to have the rest today or tomorrow! Merci Andi, make for BAY, a you will all know by now, the herb of the month in the French forum! FT:-) Wonderful, just wonderful Andi.  I actually let it sit for one week, what restraint.  Sooo good. I smash everything with my motar & pestle. My mixture  resemble a thick, tasty paste. The flavor be out of this world, just perfect with light toast and sweet grape tomatoes, this make a wonderful lunch today. I plan on have the rest tomorrow in a lovely green salad with sweet onion and cherry tomatoes.  Kudos on a great recipe that i plan on share with my friends. :) Very nice! I don\\'t currently have a food processor (it break recently) or a mortar & pestle so I put the dry spice in my spice grinder and just chop the garlic & caper with a knife. I find that once this be in the fridge, the oil turn completely solid - don\\'t know if it\\'s the nature of oil or just my fridge temp (it be an old fridge and run very cold). When I want to try some (after wait impatiently for the full two weeks!) I have to scoop some out into a dish and microwave briefly to re-liquefy the oil, which also warm & soften up the cheese a bite - but that be kinda nice, actually! :) I mix in a few halve grape tomato and eat with slice of whole wheat baguette (toasted). Thanks for share this recipe Andi! Absolutely lovely!  Simple to make, a well - this would be a perfect gift for a foodie.  I can\\'t wait until this have marinate long enough for u to try it on toast with ripe tomatoes.  The only change I make be to use an organic extra virgin olive oil with herbs.  Thanks so much for the recipe, Andi!  And thank breezermom for put it in your Best of 2010 recipe book so I could tag it! Yum! I\\'ve just try it after three day of marinate and already the flavor have blend beautifully. The olive oil play a big part in the flavor so I think it\\'s worth use a really good quality one.',\n",

Thanks, Carole Inez, thank for this recipe.  Very easy to make and different from most others we\\'ve tried.

       " ' These be sooo good! I have exactly enough fill for one whole box of manicotti shells. I really like the flavor that the cream cheese bring to the fill -- sometimes I find that pasta fill with pure ricotta cheese be just too, well, ricotta-y, but the cream cheese make this perfect. I didn&#039;t have any Paul Newman sauce, so I sub in one jar of Barilla Traditional sauce and one big jar of Victoria marinara sauce. I think I end up use more sauce than be require because the Victoria sauce be a Costco-sized jar, but it thicken up quite a bite in the oven, and we like pasta heavy on the sauce anyhow. I be initially worry that the pasta wouldn&#039;t soften enough if it wasn&#039;t pre-cooked, but it be just right after it&#039;s time in the oven (soft but not soggy). I could fit all but 4 of the manicotti in one big pan, so I put the last of the manicotti in a small (1.5 quart) Corningware dish. I be hop to keep the small dish for photo purpose and leave the large casserole pan for DH to take his dinner from, but when I get home from work, I realize that DH have use the small dish a his dinner plate, lol.

Simple, easy and great. The mushroom and dress be so good though that next time I might double it.\",\n",

This be indeed good if you eat it the next day.  Out of the oven I be go to give it a 4, but it be good a few minute late and definitely a 5 the next day.  It seem that the pumpkin flavor come out more and that it be a little sweeter.  Anyway, great cornbread.  When I eat it just out of the oven it may have be slightly underdone, but this give it a pumpkin pie like texture, which I like very much.  Either it cook a little more a it cool or maybe it dry out a little, but after that it simply taste like an awesome pumpkin bread, just with the hint of cornbread in it.  Very moist.  This recipe totally rocks!  I be normally skeptical about a recipe that have only be review once prior, but since this be Kittencal I know it would be good.  By the way, I use sour cream.  I've use it in other cornbread recipe and it seem to be great for get that moist texture. We love how these turn out!  We use the buttermilk and we make them into mini muffin (only need to cook for 25 minute at same temp) and they be the perfect size and taste!  Thank You KITTENCAL! Wow!  Love this!  My favorite bread comfort food be cornbread and I love pumpkin & cranberries.  What could be good all together?  It be very moist too.  Lovely flavor.  Next time I might even add more cranberries.  Also use canola oil instead of butter & eggbeater instead of egg & fatfree plain yogurt instead of sour cream.  All work very well a substitutions. This be very yummy!  I substitute cream cheese/milk for the sour cream and mine come out a lot thick - I have to flatten my batter in the pan before baking.  Very tasty and flavorful, just the right sweetness.

       " ' Steve this be such a neat recipe in that you bake the chicken and potato separately but in the same pan - easy cleanup.  The chicken be moist and flavorful (garlic) a be the potato which my family devoured.  I like that this recipe call for you to butterfly the chicken rather than bake the bird intact - make for a nice presentation.  Thanks so much for share your recipe! Steve, this be the only way to go -  The brine be great!   ~  keep the chicken really moist.   My hubby use brown sugar instead of white. Steve, you must develop recipe for \"Cook\\'s Illustrated\" magazine. ;) Oh this be so very nice. Absolutely wonderful smell come from my kitchen this weekend when I make this bird. The brine keep the chicken so moist and tender and the garlic & butter dripping on the potato add excellent flavor. I love the presentation of this dish and add fresh green bean and crusty roll on the side. Thanks so much! Loved this one Steve! Steve, this be fantastic.  My husband and I really enjoy the flavours.  The potato be perfect, crispy, and flavourful.  And you\\'ve teach me a new and quick way to prepare a whole chicken.  I will definately make this one again. Terrific chicken Steve!!! \\r\\nWanted to try a different way to roast my bird..and since you\\'ve talk so highly of this method..had to give it a try.  I\\'m glad that I did!   This be terrfic in every respect.  It be quick and easy to put together, taste fantastic and cleanup be a breeze.  Dh say THREE time (as he go back for more) how great it taste and I agree.  As we be clean up he ask why it be sooo moist.  I LOVE the taste of the roast potato cook this way.  I use the recipe to roast a 1/2 turkey, something the local grocer occasionally make available.  It be 8.78 pounds, brine for 4 hours, roast for 40 minutes, turned, and roast another 40 minutes.  What a great technique!! I love this recipe and make it all the time.  I just wish that i have room to make more potatoes! Sensational recipe!  Tender, moist, crispy chicken with smothered, garlicky melt in the mouth potato (I waffle cut mine for presentation purposes).  My first attempt at brine and I\\'ll \\'never go back\\'.  Thanks for offer this wonderful recipe. LOVELY, LOVELY! This be the 3rd grill chicken recipe that I try from recipezaar. When I want to make grill chicken again, my hubby request for a repeat of this (thumbs up!). I use molasses instead of sugar and I press some, ok lot of garlic to mix with butter with extra portion. While the grill be still hot after the chicken be out, I toast some bread and spread the extra portion of garlic butter. Mmmmm.... The potato be very good too. I throw in some slice carrot in with the potato and in the last 15 minutes, add some onion wedge a well. Thank you for post this! Who could not love this delicious chicken??? :)  It be the best I have ever had!  It sound like alot of work- but it be worth it! Thanks so much for sharing! I try this for the 1st time a month ago and I be make it again tonight! My family of 5 love this meal! This be by far, the tasty roast chicken I\\'ve ever made! I\\'ve do butterflied chicken before but the garlic butter under the skin, not to mention the brining, make the difference in the moistness of the meat.  And the potatoes, what can I say but DIVINE! Afreind stop by while we be eat and there be a fight over them.  I make extra the next time I make it and they be even great cold the next day.  Perfect!  Only thing I do different be toss some garlic in with the potatoes. I have make this recipe twice now, it\\'s a big hit with the family.  I have do it both time with bone in skin on chicken breast and adjust the time accordingly.  I also cheat and just put it in a 13x9 bake dish layer the breast directly on top of the potatoes.  This be an easy and tasty meal! This be very easily the BEST chicken I have EVER cooked! It take a little time and effort but be soooo worth it. I add 3 clove of mince garlic to the potato when I toss the in the oil and they be absolutely divine. My husband and I eat until we be miserable and then fight over the leftover the next day! The potato themselves be worth try this recipe. Five stars, all the way! Just can\\'t believe how the high temp can work on chicken and I didn\\'t burn it. Have make this several time and it be a hit every time.Thanks for share this gem! thank you very much for this amaze recipee,its great mmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm!!!!\\n\\ni\\'ve make this about five time now, it\\'s a once a week meal this winter. every time - this have turn out beautifully!\\nthe only deviation from the i\\'ve make recipe be i also toss garlic with the potatoes.\\ni herb the butter with lot of garlic, rosemary, thyme, and sage - and either serve a crisp salad or roast veggie on the side.\\n\\nfantastic, thank you!! Here be another 5 star review...This recipe be AMAZING!! My DH (who hat chicken) love this recipe and be lick his fingers!! I have the chicken in the brine for about 1 1/2 hours, and it be a moist bird!! I also toss the potato with some fresh rosemary, thyme, salt and pepper which make the house smell DIVINE with the garlic in the butter!! What a great presentation, and easy to carve, I thought. Thank you for a wonderful chicken recipe that my DH will eat!!! What a family pleaser! We live in the tropic and I don\\'t like to use the large oven so usually try to find way to cook on the stave top or use the toaster oven. Here be what I did: I soak the bird in brine 1/2 the day.  Once butterfly cut, I then split the bird in 1/2 and roast it in the toaster oven directly on the rack with the potato in the roast pan below. My oven only go up to 450 but since it\\'s smaller, it take about the same amount of time to cook through.   I also throw in a carrot with the potatoes.  Yummm all the way around! We make this last night and it be really wonderful! I only brine it for 2 hour and it be really juicy. I change it up to add rosemary and lemon inside the cavity to cook. I also put some garlic butter under the skin and it be great. What I like about this simple recipe be that you can mix it up with what you have in the house. Our 3 pound chicken cook in about 1 hour, 20 minute and it be perfect! Great recipe. Easy, fast, and turn out just lovely with little effort. Just a quick tip for people who didn\\'t have time to let the bird rest in the fridge after brine before cooking... pat the bird dry with some paper towel, and lightly dust the skin with cornstarch. Rub the cornstarch in lightly- this make fantastic crispy skin. Thanks Steve_G! I have this ready when my hubby get home.  It turn out great.  I wasn\\'t able to let it sit in the fridge overnight, but someone have suggest put cornstarch on the skin to help it crisp.  I\\'m allergic to corn so I use potato starch and this help some, but it still wasn\\'t a crispy a I would have liked.  I trim A LOT of the extra skin off so I didn\\'t have to worry about the potato get greasy.  I also add slice carrots.  Thanks for a great recipe. Very good, I especially love the potato do this way. I add some chop carrot too. It would be good with chunk of onion a well. The chicken seem perfect, do in a 450 oven , I be afraid to put mine on 500. DH wasn\\'t home until it have cool down so I reheat it in a 350 oven uncover after break it into pieces. This really dry the chicken. So serve this immediately or find a way to keep the chicken moist while re-heating. I have also drain the pan and make a sauce from the dripping with rice flour, Helmans olive oil mayonnaise (soy free) and water which be nice. Therefore there be no juice in the pan upon re-heating either. The chicken be soak for 1 1/2 hours. I use olive oil and crush garlic in replacement of the garlic butter and I do not leave the chicken in the fridge after remove it from soak but dry it off. It crisp a bite but not a much a I would have liked. (Did not try cornstarch to crisp it because of allergy) I have no problem with the potato be too greasy because I cut off much of the extra skin. I serve it with a salad on the side. Would try this recipe again for sure. This be the best roast chicken and potato I have ever made!! Thank you so much for this recipe. I will never roast a chicken any other way. This chicken be wonderfully moist. I make it exactly a posted, but next time I\\'ll add some herb to it (rosemary, thyme). My skin be nice and crisp! The potato be wonderful, but I do add extra garlic to the potatoes. I will definitely use this method in the future to cook my veggie with my roast poultry. A bonus with this recipe be that I learn how to butterfly a chicken! Easy to do, and now I\\'ll do it for the grill! Buying my chicken on sale bring the chicken and potato in under $6.00 for 4...very economical for me, even add in the cost of a side and dessert!  Thanks for share your wonderful recipe! This be the best roast chicken I\\'ve ever taste ! It\\'s so easy to make too. Plus cleanup be a breeze. This recipe be a keeper. I have make this three time and each time, my husband have say that it\\'s the best roast chicken he\\'s ever had. (He wonder if it be just a fluke the first time and dare me to repeat it!) Even though the first thing he usually do be peel off the skin, he actually eat it each time. <br/><br/>I have put just plain butter, garlic butter, and butter with rosemary under the skin. They be all fabulous. I also pull all excess fat out from under the skin. I do pat the chicken dry, rub cornstarch on accord to other reviewers\\' suggestions. I also put chop rosemary on the potato and throw some chop carrot in. However, the carrot seem to cook fast and turn black quite easily - probably from all the natural sugar in the carrots. I be wonder if maybe I should throw in the carrot when you rotate the chicken. (I be try that method tonight!)<br/><br/>It\\'s an impressive, but easy meal with a simple cleanup because everything be cook in one big roast pan. Very moist and flavorful, but a bite on the salty/bitter side. I would give it a 5 star rat if not for that. I will adjust it next time....and I definitely will be make this again! Maybe use some orange juice instead of lemon? Or mix the two?? Oh my goodness! YUM YUM YUM! Lovely crispy skin! Moist tender chicken! Best potato I have ever eaten! Had the inlaws over for dinner and only have half a day notice, but all the ingredient be on hand and I whip it up no problems. Used fresh mince garlic for the butter and probably double the quantity but I have no problem in use it all, stuff it under the skin a well a on top result in a very tasty dish.Also add some oregano to the potatoes. I too will continue to brine my chicken...made a real difference to the taste.MIL finally admit that I be capable of feed her precious son and go back for seconds! Unheard of!! Thanks for this recipe!',\n",

This be one of the best spaghetti sauce I think I have ever made.  The sauce be rich and very flavorful.  Had a wonderful blend of spices.  I make the first batch make only half the recipe but end up test it so much during the day I have to make the other half.  Made the second batch with 1 pound of hamburger meat, just to see if it make any difference, but it didn\\'t add much at all to this wonderful recipe.  Thanks Roger for a great recipe. I have get to give this 4 star because it be a good as, if not good than any I have made. I still be look for that one that knock my sock off. My cousin use to live with me and she make one that did. She\\'s just KookY and I can\\'t seem to get the recipe from her. Or be she smart??? Anyway this be very good, just not a good a hers. So 4 stars. Loved this sauce! The smell permeate the kitchen be wonderful, I just have to keep sampling. I love this recipe because of all the spices. The only thing I changed, be I only use 1/2 pound of mushroom and that be only because I be not a fan of the fungi but my husband is, so I meet him halfway on the amount. Thanks for another great recipe, Roger! Great! Simmered most of the day then add Recipe #28248. Omitted the mushroom cause the kid don\\'t eat them. Guess I get distract cause I add a third can of dice tomato (rather than whole) by mistake and add a cup of wine, again by mistake, because apparently I hallucinate those part of the recipe LOL. It be still wonderful! Thanks for share the recipe! Excellent sauce - make exactly a direct except I leave out the mushrooms.  I be wondering, though, be the fresh parsley necessary?  I didn\\'t notice the taste of it and go out to buy it specifically.  Next time I\\'ll try dry to see if I can taste the difference.  I also might leave out the green pepper a my family be not a fan (although no one complained).  Thank you for share your recipe!',\n",

I recall a story about your dad&#039;s health, and how we crave healthy snack when he could no long have the other.  We have pas this recipe around the family tree and would love to recall the story behind this incredible cookie.  Making some tonight despite the Florida heat wave.  Yolanda, ycoch',\n",
       " ' This be a nice recipe. I make it with 5 dozen eggs, but only use 3 stick of celery, a I think it might over power the dish and I use sour cream instead of yoghurt (that\\'s all I had).\\r\\nA good easy recipe, altough peel all those egg make me wish for an \"egg peeler\". I will put this recipe in my cookbook for the moment, but after read Jan S.\\'s review and comment on peel all the egg i want to let you all know of a little trick i find for peeling.  Unfortunately, it only work when the egg be still hot, but put up to a dozen in a PLASTIC pasta strainer and (holding them above the kitchen sink) bounce them gently in the strainer.  The egg will bounce up and down and bump into each other, crack the shells.  Within just a couple minute the shell will be fall off the egg in very large, almost whole pieces.  The best part is, if they\\'re for devil egg there be very little chance of have break or gouge whites. I love this recipe, it be easily adaptable yet wonderful just a it is.  I have make it before even substitute celery seed when I be out of celery and it be still good! Easy, quick and delicious!! ( I skip the dill at my wife\\'s suggestion however.)  Thanks Tish. i\\'ve be try to work more protein into my diet and this recipe be perfect for the task.  i omit the dill and use nonfat sour cream in lieu of yoghurt/mayo b/c that\\'s all i have on hand.  the only thing i would change be to use a little le onion b/c i find it a tad overpowering. Very quick and easy. Now I do know what to do with those leave over Easter egg a you have stated. Great recipe. Easy recipe...I make only 6 color egg for my husband and I for an Easter basket.  I halve this recipe very easily and it be pretty tasty!  Thanks Tish for sharing..I will make again. I love dill in salad but didn\\'t have a good dilled egg salad until now. Thanks, Tish, for enrich my repertoire! Wonderful recipe.  I halve the recipe and didn\\'t have any celery, so I omit that, and I only have white onions.  Still come out great. I halve the recipe, and follow it exactly!  The 1tsp of salt be still to much.  I think it would have be good with a dash of salt instead.  But it be still good.  \\n\\nThank You! A nice egg salad for those leftover hard boil eggs.   I do cut down on the salt.  I be not an egg salad fan, but my husband & daughter love it! It be good but I make it with yogurt instead of mayo and it seem to lack something.  Next time I will use mayo.  Thank you for posting! Quick and easy recipe.  I learn that if I sub yellow mustard, I should cut back a little or it\\'ll be quite tangy :) I make this yesterday for lunch.  My friend that come out to visit say egg salad sound good.  It be really good.  I will be make this again.  Thanks for the great recipe. Now this be certainly a new take on egg salad! I enjoy the change of pace. The whole grain mustard be a really nice twist in this recipe. Thank you! I really enjoy this recipe. I use mayonnaise for this recipe. It be really enjoyable. This be so good and I be worry I would not like this. I make this and have to add potato because it be too salty.  I use mayonnaise instead of plain yogurt and wonder if that would have make a difference. I think that this salad be good and well balanced. I make it the day before to have for supper after work. I get the typical kid result (daughter doesn\\'t like raw onion but like it and son wasn\\'t even interest enough to eat at all). After the second day it extrude extra liquid which stir back in fine. I couldn\\'t get fresh dill so use 2 tsp. dry and like the flavor (very unique). This taste good plain, on Triscuits, and on Saltines (no one have make a sandwich with it yet.) I use whole milk yogurt. I be look for an egg salad recipe, with fresh dill a an ingredient, and try yours.  (There aren\\'t too many, with dill, BTW)  Anyway, I make 1/4 of the recipe, use mayo, and leave out the lemon juice.  I also leave out the salt, til the end, because of the reviews.  I serve it on lightly toast wheat bread, with lettuce and tomato, and salt and pepper.  Fast and yummy; thanks! Easy and good egg salad. I use green onion rather than the red and serve it open face on a slice of sourdough and lettuce. Thanks Tish for a nice lunch. Made for I Recommend Tag. I make two bowls, one with mayo and one with yogurt. Both be yummy! I do cut the salt by half though My family and I love this recipe. We make one little change though. Instead of whole grain mustard we find that mustard seed work great. They give it a nice little pop.',\n",
       " ' Uncle Bill, you just keep on make up these fantastic recipes!  This chicken be incredibly moist, and the flavor be out of this world.  The simple coat of mayonnaise, dill, and lemon be delicate and refreshing.  I particularly like bake chicken for dietary reasons, and this method of bake still leave the chicken moist.  Thanks again, William! Wow!! Uncle Bill, this be the best!! We really love the flavor of the dill here. This have to be the most tender, moist chicken....but it have the crispness outside. And NO frying! This one be great, it will be make here a lot! Thank you so much for sharing! You give me a great idea Uncle Bill...I try this with fish!  I use some nice fresh cod and it turn out soooooo delicious.  Try it for yourself. Adding more of the same comment - moist chicken, flavorful and delicious. Why would anyone want greasy, fry chicken? I might try this with thyme in place of the dill. This be excellent - even with the modification I be force to make:\\r\\nI have no lemon juice, I sub regular salt for the season salt, and I have no garlic powder so I use fresh garlic.  I also try it on fish and it be excellent!  Oh, yeah, I almost forget - I only have breadcrumb (no cornflakes) and that work out well, too!  I will try this again and use the cornflakes - probably give it more of a crunch.   What can I say, Uncle Bill -- another winner here!  This dish be just delicious.  I do have to double all of the amount (except the chicken, of course) to have enough to coat, but boy be I glad I did!  I use chicken thigh and pound them, so perhaps I end up with more chicken surface than if I have use chicken breasts... In any case, another fantastic dish and I thank you for the recipe!  \\r\\nDianne This be an excellent dish and I have make it a few times.  The only advice I could give be to definitely let the excess mayo drip off before coat with the corn flake mixture or you will end up with a VERY rich and oily chicken breast. We love this recipe!  Like the other reviewer said, this chicken be very moist on the inside, crunchy on the outside.  I make the recipe a written.  You can definitely taste the dill and lemon--a very tasty combination.  I agree with Kara0473; the mayo mixture really cling to the chicken, so I try to remove the excess.  Like Geema and HeatherDiane, I think  this would taste great use white fish fillets.   Thanks, Uncle Bill, for a great recipe I know I will be use often. My family prefer the mustard version over the mayo of this recipe.  However, I really like the skim milk and cornflakes crust and think the dill weed add an extra something.  I do have to triple the cornflake mixture in order to cover 4 average boneless chicken breasts. MUST TRY!!! I make this recipe a while ago and be just now get around to review it, but I can\\'t speak of it highly enough!! It be just so delish and make me look like a gourmet chef to all of my bf friend who drop by unexpectedly and scrumped up all of the leftover compliment me and tell him he didn\\'t know what he had. Truly a perfect dish! Thank you for this wonderful recipe!! This have a wonderful flavor and be easy, too.  What could be better?  Great alternative to fry chicken.  Thanks Uncle Bill! The only thing I do different be to use \"Special K\" instead of corn flake (that\\'s all I had). I will be make this many times. Thanks for the keeper.\\n\\nEdited-Thanks for ruin all the other chicken recipe I find! Every time I see a new one, I think, will it be a good a Uncle Bill\\'s? Then I make your\\'s again. The chicken be very moist and delicious. I cheat and use bottle ranch dress instead of mix the mayo with the seasonings. Then add black pepper and a little dill weed to the skim milk powder/corn flake mixture. Thanks Uncle Bill! Great recipe!  I really enjoy make this and then eat it a well. I must say it be VERY moist on the inside and then crunchy on the outside.  I didn\\'t vary too much from the basic recipe... I don\\'t cook with salt (or very rarely) so I substitute Mrs. Dash table blend for the season salt.  I also use fat free mayo and do not use the powder milk.  I also add some Mrs. Dash\\'s Extra spicey.  Ok, I vary a little more than I though!  I will make this again, it\\'s really good and the family love it too.  And easy, do I mention easy?  Thanks so much for posting. Happy cooking.  :) I must have do something wrong with all these great reviews.  The taste be a little off-putting to me We REALLY enjoy this recipe at our house. I have to say that it\\'s hard to find recipe I don\\'t have to beg my kid to eat. This be definitely kid friendly! My two munchkins eat every bite of this up with no problems. I cute the big piece of chicken into cutlet so it be more like chicken nuggets, something they\\'re more familiar with. I think my 2 year old eat a much a I did...I do everything a suggested, which be not normal for me. The only thing I\\'d make sure I emphasize be that if you want the outside crunchy, make sure you get a bunch of the mayo mix off. The one that be le crispy be still excellent!! I do have to note that I do have to go and make more of a cornflake/powdered milk combo, but that may have be because I be get a lot of the mayo mix on. The dill definitely make this recipe, and you would never be able to figure out what it be if you didn\\'t know! Edit: 2 time now I\\'ve use 2 c. corn flake an 1/3 c. powder milk to make sure I have enough, but I cut my chicken into nugget and tenders.',\n",

I mix the broccoli into the sauce right before serving. It work out great. Thanks for post this recipe. Its a keeper. I'm only sorry that I forget to take a picture. Next time!

       " \" This sound like the black bean pinwheel recipe from the Kraft site...I absolutely love this recipe and have have people request it constantly for gatherings.  I make a few change though..to make thing easier, I start with refried black bean (don't process required), use monterey jack cheese with the jalapenos, and add some garlic powder to the fill before rolling. I serve with hot and mild salsa.   Very very good.   We love these! I skip the blender, mash the bean with a spoon, put the cream cheese in the microwave for about 8 sec.  They go together in a snap and I like the fact that you could make it ahead of time and serve with guest arrive. Made by an Epicurean Queen for ZWT5. Very good, very easy recipe for entertaining.

Made for ZWT5, for the Groovy GastroGnomes.\",\n",
       " \" Easy quick and very tasty! Skipped the oil! What a great way to deal with leftover - fry rice without the frying. I use leftover duck instead of shrimp, also skip the oil. Very easy light meal. Like the previous reviewer – I be use a non-stick pan – I omit the oil, and I make this with a can of pink salmon (drained), instead of the shrimps: it’s what I have on hand.  I cook the rice first so that it be ready to add when I need it and, in step four, I add 4 clove of chop garlic, a cup of thinly slice mushroom (I just can’t resist throw in garlic and mushroom whenever and wherever I see the possibility of do so!) and a teaspoon of dry thyme.  They only need about 5 minute cook time.  A versatile and delicious recipe which I’m sure I’ll make differently each time I make it.  Thank you so much for share this fabulous low fat recipe! really good stuff fast to put together I make this for lunch use precook brown rice and snap pea along with a can of tiny shrimp.

Made for ZWT7~ Dinner & A Movie ~Part Two. Quick (especially if you have cook rice in the fridge, which I did), easy and versatile, what a lovely dish, ideal for a midweek supper.    I cut down on the peas, add in some freeze corn,  and chop up 2 skin fresh tomato and toss them in, just add some extra colour and vegetables!    Much enjoyed, thank you Leslie! This be one of those recipe that end up be more than the sum of it's parts. I use a little extra bacon because I have some that need use and add some mince garlic with the bacon. It didn't need salt add and be just delicious. It's a keeper and will be add to my Favorites of 2012 cookbook. :D I scale this down to 2 serve and use leftover rice. I also add mince garlic.

       " ' I\\'m always look for new recipe for chicken breasts, & I wasn\\'t disappoint with this one! It be definitely OUTSTANDING in my book! Although originally reluctant when it come to horseradish, this be the 2nd recipe I\\'ve make that use it, & I\\'m about ready to jump on the horseradish band wagon! The one change I make in the recipe be because I don\\'t have a grill, so bake the breasts, & they be really great! Many thank for share ~ This recipe go into my \"must-make-often\" pile! This chicken be moist, tender, flavorful and delicious!  I use chicken tender and grill them on my George Foreman Grill for about 6 minutes.  This be so easy!  I could really taste the flavor of the soy sauce, which I love.  Thanks, Lainey6605 for a keeper recipe! This recipe make a very moist and tender chicken breast and be so easy to do. I think next time I would reduce the soy sauce a little, it be a bite salty for me, but DH love it just the way it was. This be a great dish to prepare ahead of time and take to the lake in the summer. Thanks, Lainey! Fabulous!!! This be my new #1 chicken marinade! The odd combination of ingredient intrigue me, but it all work perfectly together. I use 12 chicken tenders, but would have enough marinade for 6-8 more. Definitely company worthy. Terrific recipe!  So many terriyaki chicken recipe be over-powering - not this one!  I be surprise at how moist and tender the chicken turn out.  And this get an A+ for ease in preparation.

I have not prepare this delicious dish, but I have have the pleasure of enjoy it at a luncheon Toolie host for our own Elly in Canada, and I didn\\'t think I care for Lamb, it be absolutly perfect! I will definatly give it a try! Thanks Toolie!!  I be the lucky person who be serve this delicious recipe at my birthday luncheon. The lamb chop be succulent, the sauce be delicious! Toolie, thank you for share another of your very simple and tasty recipes. Toolie, the picture look different to your recipe because I only have shoulder chop IN ONE PIECE! I mean it for a roast, but make your recipe instead. I use my large pan, slow-braised the shoulder piece, and follow your recipe exactly. It be delicious, and become even good because it have to wait in a warm oven for a while -- the flavour be sooo Italian! Great. I will try this with other meats, too. This be the kind of prefer food now, which the TV chef call \"clear\" flavours, or \"honest\" food. All the flavour shine through.  \\r\\n DH and I serve this for dinner a few night ago.  It be a delicious and different way to prepare lamb chops.  We enjoy it very much.  I didn\\'t have a red pepper on hand, so I use a combination of yellow and orange bell peppers.  I think it enhance the presentation of the dish and make it more colorful.  DH suggest that next time, he would chop the green olive to good distribute the olives.  Thanks for post this lovely dish.

       " \" I reduce this down to 4 serve use 1 granny smith apple and 2 cloves. I also add a dash of sugar to the pot while cooking, and sprinkle sugar and cinammon on top before baking. This be a very light brunch item but it need more tweeking for sweeten (raisins perhaps?) and more cinammon to bring out additional flavor. Also, I think add an small hole on top of the pastry prior to bake would help it not deflate a much. Overall, a nice recipe just need some minor adjustments. Ehhh... think it be the clove that be too overpowering.  Made it taste like medicine.  Theres a recipe with biscuit that be good on here: Recipe #301054 but that's only my preference.  Sorry - maybe will try again by decrease the amount of cloves. I love this recipe. It be so quick and easy to throw together.  Everyone that try them...loved them.  I grind my 3 fresh clove and didn't find them over powering. The pastry be crisp and the apple fill tart and tender.  I do add an additional apple, a we prefer alot of fruit.  I will make these again and again. Thanks for share I'mPat . Well I have to say that i have high expectation for this recipe.  I would have rather it be a little sweeter.  As the sugar be optional I didn't add it cuz I be afraid it be go to be sweet.  But I wish I have add it :(  My daughter too be a bite more sweetness, she top it with crispy ice=cream top and whip cream.  Made for Everyday be a Holiday tag game.

GREAT! i add some garlic because i be afraid it would be a little bland, and only have regular pepper so use that instead. but WONDERFUL recipe. lot of compliments! eat it with both cracker AND tortilla chips. Thank so much! This be a good dip.  It be nice for a change.  Think next time I'll use 2 avocado's though.  I add a few shake of garlic powder also.  Served with tortilla chip & avocado rice cakes. I use more avocado and le cream cheese.  This be OK, nice and creamy, but really mild.  I don't think I would make it again. I want to make a different guacamole for a change of pace.

Has a fill that be chock full of healthy, fresh vegetables. Very upscale. Definitely a few step up from PB&J ;) My husband, who think you have to have meat with every meal enjoy it. The oil and vinegar add zest. Thanks  I leave out the oil, sprouts, and pepper and this be still yummy.  I be worry this would leave me hungry, but it didn\\'t.  I love the velvety texture of the avocado. Oh my!  What a great taste sandwich.  I use an onion roll rather than the bread call for in the recipe.  I leave off the sprout due to my own personal taste.  After add the tomato I sprinkle with some fresh grind pepper and some fresh parmesan cheese.  This result in a sandwich that look like it be wait to be gobble up, so I obliged!  LOL!  Thanks Sharon123 for another delicious recipe! I\\'ve be make variation on this for year ~ great stuff! (Dh never have try it...he just chalk it up to have marry a hippie-granola-mountain chick, lol!) I especially like it on a lightly toast bagel; add a great chewy texture and make it very filling. I don\\'t always use oil/vinegar, some day I prefer a light flavor, but the great thing about this recipe be all the room for different options. Nothing quite beat that basic cream cheese-avacado-sprout combo, though! :o) Oh very nice.  It\\'s be a long time since I\\'ve have a veggie sandwich and this be wonderful.  Loved the olive oil and red wine vinegar combo on this sandwich.  I apparently didn\\'t read step 5 and it be on top with the lettuce and the first bite, all of them shoot out of the sandwich.  That be okay, just put them back in where they belong and we get along fine afterwards.  Very good. A really great sandwich - thanks! I miss out the alfalfa a I\\'m not a fan, and use a granary roll and low fat cream cheese. yum! This be very good. My daughter and I make veggie sandwich like this all the time and we love them. Thank you for share this keeper recipe. I make a variation of this sandwich every summer when I\\'ve get garden-fresh tomato and cukes. I\\'ve never try it with the sprout and peppers, but plan to now. I be plan to type my recipe in, but now I don\\'t hae to! I could eat one of these everyday!  I didn\\'t use the sprout or avocado this time, but do incorporate sun-dried tomatoes.  I also add some sun-dried tomato and chop green onion to the cream cheese spread.  This be a big hit! This be a new lunch favorite for me!!  I add some fresh grind pepper and oregano on top of the oil and vinegar.  Absolutely FABULOUS!!! Another plus be that I usually have all these ingredient on hand, so it\\'s great for those day when I don\\'t feel like \"making lunch.\" THANKS!!! What a wonderful sandwich!  Simple to put together and have great flavor.  I toast up slice of some rosemary olive oil bread and that go really well with the filling.  Thanks Sharon! This be a great sandwich to take to school, and very healthy!  I use regular bread which I wouldn\\'t recommend (the cream cheese wouldn\\'t spread and the bread get soggy) but the sandwich be still great! Tasted just like one you would order at Subway! I\\'ve be eat this every day for awhile now. I love it. Definately use a nice \"hard bread\", so that it doesn\\'t get soggy. I use a county loaf. I do a couple change to suit my taste... I use baby spinach instead of lettuce and no pepper or oil. I mash the avacado into the cream cheese. My husband add red onion to his. I really enjoy this tasty sandwich.  I use a whole wheat bagel but otherwise follow the recipe.  Almost make me not feel guilty for eat a 2 pound bag of peanut M&M\\'s.  (just kidding!!  :-)  ) Love it! I use lightly toast rye bread and omit the sprout because I be not a fan of them. All the ingredient of this sandwich blend so well together and create a very satisfy and yummy veggie sandwich. I sprinkle a little sea salt and fresh crack pepper on my tomato and find it give just a little something extra to suit my tastes. I\\'ll make this often. Thank you! This be a great sandwich. I lightly toast my bread and realize at the last minute that I didn\\'t have any avocado, so I throw on some red onion instead. Yummy! Here in Northern California, we call this sandwich \"The Californian\".  It be superb!  Thanks for share it with the rest of the world.  :) Now this be tasty! Omitted the alfalfa sprout a I didn\\'t have any; next time I\\'ll add a slice or two of red onion for a bite more bite. Great sammich, thank for sharing! I love this sandwich and will make it often! I love this sammie.  For the simple reason that I have all these ingreidents on hand this time of year.  I do omit the avocado bc they\\'re so terribly expensive in the store right now.  I toast by bread also.  Great recipe!!!! Yummy...my favourite kind of sandwich...the cream cheese be a great idea...I just put whatever fresh veggie I have in my fridge, which fortunately right now be quite an assortment. MMMmmm....can\\'t wait to have another one. I\\'ll have to grow some sprout for this time around! Very good sandwich!  I only wish my tomato be \"in season\", then it would probably have blow me away.  Loving avocado right now, and that be what draw me to the recipe.  Delicious!  Thanks for sharing! Made for Zaar Chef Alphabet Soup Tag. I sub arugula for alfalfa sprouts, Persian cucumber for standard and&lt;br/&gt;baby arugula for lettuce. Very good! Served with Recipe #393433. Reviewed for&lt;br/&gt;Veg Tag/June. Nice combo! I love veggie sandwich and never put cream cheese on mine, this be a nice change. I add thin slice onion and I would skip the olive oil next time. I serve it on toast rye. Thanks for share the recipe. I just want to say a big thank you too whoever put this on here. This be an Flippin phenomenal sandwich.

       " \" make these today for hubby (yeah, just a little late for Christmas, I know) I omit anise seed and pistachio because I have none, but put in raw almond instead.  The texture of the dough be quite unlike any biscotti I've work with, and I be a little iffy on the fennel seeds...but, when they be done, I be really happy with them.  The fennel give them a lovely flavor, and I would at least double it next time if I didn't have anise. For all the low calorie and carbs, I'd say we have a pretty nice cookie here! I've make similar biscotti before, at least with the cranberries, pistachio & anise, but the fennel & apricot add a nice twist, something we enjoy very much! I'm no coffee lover but usually eat these a the great taste cooky they are! Still, I've be know to dunk them into a nice hot chocolate now & then! Thanks for a great recipe keeper, Annacia!

These be the best meatball - every time I make them - they be a hit with everyone.   I make these for my daughter\\'s birthday party. No one could believe the combination of grape jelly and chili sauce create such a delicious meatball. These be so easy to make and make a hearty appetizer. Great for a holiday buffet! I cut the recipe in half and cook it 5 hour on low in my crockpot. I just put the meatball in the pot, whisk the chili sauce and jelly together in a bowl and pour it over the top. When they be do I turn the pot down to the \"keep warm\" set and serve them at an open house. Everyone love them. It\\'s fun to watch people face when they ask for the recipe and you tell them it\\'s grape jelly and chili sauce! Very easy and very good.  I put freeze meatball in the crockpot and cover with the jelly and chili sauce- then set it on high for 2 1/2 hours. Very good! Thanks for the recipe! I use my croc pot and have them in for 3 hour on high. I have make these for years, and they be SO GOOD! Always the first appetizer to go. Don\\'t tell anyone what\\'s in it though, they freak out, and make icky faces, but when they try it, I always get a \"WOW, these ARE good!\". Just TRY IT YOURSELF Excellent!  I make a couple addition - add 1/2 tsp garlic powder, & 1 Tbs lemon juice to the sauce.  Put it in the crockpot for 2 1/2 hour on high.\\r\\n\\r\\nEveryone love this recipe.  A try and true recipe!  Always a hit at the party.  I add a little Worchestershire sauce and ginger then thicken it by mix some of the sauce with cornstarch, that way the sauce stay with the meatball. These meatball be OK, in my opinion they be too sweet.  We\\'ve be eat these since I be a young girl (long time ago)\\r\\nTo cut some of the sweetness...I add a jar of pickle jalapenos...sounds weird but really good!!\\r\\nI also prefer homemade meatballs. These be wonderful. I make my own meatball and bake them before mix with the thicken sauce. I cook the sauce while the meatball be baking. As the other reviewer wrote, I also have be make the for quite some tiem. Thanks for sharing. Excellent recipe!  A friend of mine make these for a bridal shower and when she tell me what be in them I nearly died!!!  My cousin be just marry and I use this recipe to make meatball for her Wedding reception!  I triple it and have enough to for 65 people.  It be really really easy!  And taste great!  Thanks so much from me and my cousin! We have this at our wed reception, and we get lot of great comments.  Thanks! My family have make these for years.  Instead of meatballs, try little cocktail weiners.  I have be make these for a long time and they be always a big hit! I just never think to post the recipe. I also use this sauce recipe use Lil\\' Smokies and that be a hit too. Thanks for post this recipe! I make this for a party last weekend, and it be wonderful.  Everyone ask me what be in them - I\\'ll definitely make them for our other party next weekend.  Thank you! My mom have be make this recipe for years!!It\\'s fantastic! Excellent!!! I buy freeze meatball and use chili sauce and raspberry chipotle sauce for the grape jelly.  I throw it all in my crockpot in the morning and it turn into a fabulous, easy appetizer! Hi Kittencal! I post this same recipe for my Kilbasa recipe #177789. I never think of use meatball but will be try that very soon! Thanks for a great idea.. just change the meat! These be fine for a New Year\\'s Party, but rather too sweet for our tastes. I discover that we prefer a savory meatball. We\\'ve be make these for years!  You\\'d never guess it be grape jelly!  Lil Smokies be good add with the meatballs!  Great recipe  :) So very good again I use your recipe#69173 (I make 6 pound of grind beef and pork with your meatball recipe, it\\'s the best) this recipe make lots, thank Kit I really like the flavor of the chili sauce and grape jelly.  My kid think it be ok,(they be just hook on bbq sauce).  But I will make this again a I think it be much good then just a bottle of bbq.  I make these for a get together we be have and use 10 lb of meatball and they be ALL gone.....Thank you for another variety for make meatballs.      Stephanie These be absolutely the best!  I have make them for a wed shower, a baby shower, and for the church.  Everyone love them and they be SUPER easy to make!  Thanks kittencal!! Great appy- thank for posting- we have not make in years- have to make this soon- so easy and yummy ! I make these for a gather at my home and they be well received.  Next time I\\'ll use more cayenne pepper.  I would have personally like it a bite more spicy.  Thanks for the recipe. Awesome!! I first have these year ago and be hook but this recipe step it up a knotch with that little somethin\\' somethin\\' call cayenne - delish!! great recipe for appetizers, i also like to just throw everything together in my crockpot and let it cook slowly all day, thank kittencal. My work & I love them very simple taste great! I too have use this \"recipe\" for years.  Lil Smokies be our favorite.  Thanks for posting! This be one of my favorite dishes!! So easy, simple and yummy!! I always eat this with rice.  By the way, if you haven\\'t try it this way but try use apple jelly or jelly cranberry sauce and it\\'s all so yummy! Wow these be really good. A lady make these for my son\\'s boy scout Christmas party. I have never make meatball like this (actually I think the combination of jelly and chili sauce sound weird together) but I make these tonight for dinner and everyone love them. These be so easy to make. I follow the recipe exactly a written, use five pound of freeze meatballs. I didn\\'t add the optional cayenne pepper. I will be make these more often. Thanks Kit! What a crowd pleaser!  Had a small get together and everyone love these little morsel and ask for the recipe.  Thanks for submitting. This be something my sister make for the holiday when she live out here... although the ingredient seem to be an odd combination, it be FANTASTIC!! Whenever I make this, I have to muster up the willpower to not eat the entire batch. Great stuff! I make this for a holiday party and it be the first thing gone.  That might have be because my kid eat about 1/2 of it before I even get to the party!  I add some barbecue sauce too.  It be very good! This be great with Kittencal\\'s outstanding \"Famous Italian Melt-in-Your-Mouth Meatballs\".  The prep for this sauce could not be any easier.  I blend the jelly, chili sauce, & cayenne pepper together in my crockpot with my immersion blender, add the freeze meatballs, turn the crockpot on high, and serve about 3-4 hour later.  They go fast!  Thanks, Kittencal! This be a geat no brainer appetizer to make especially during the frenzied time of the holidays.  Yay for tasty stress free recipes! I have be use this recipe for year and everyone have always LOVED it.. I actually be ask to make it so often that I be get burn out on them when I never think I would. They be just so yummy and so easy you can\\'t beat it. Cooked these for my dinner group last night and they be a hit!\\r\\nDown here in South Texas we have to have a big kick so I add about a cup of slice jar jalapeno and a lot more than a pinch of cayenne and 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder.\\r\\nEveryone love them!\\r\\nThanks Kitten! i be skeptical because i don\\'t like really really sweet anything...but im glad i try these! i only have about 2 lb of meatball so there be a lot of extra sauce, but we werent complaining. i\\'ll definately make these bugger again. i use freeze meatball for this recipe, but next time i\\'ll definately make my own meatball because there be no comparison. for a quick && easy meal or appetizer, this be my new go to recipe. These be great - I use a mix of cocktail meatball and smokies in a 5qt slow cooker. We\\'ve get leftovers, which be fine with me - I\\'ll serve them over noodle w/ a veggie for dinner tonight. Thanks for a great one, Kitten! Made for superbowl sunday, use meatball recipe #216580. They be a hit! I try this use Lil Smokies and apricot/pineapple preserve a that be what I have on hand.  I like these but prefer them cook with barbeque sauce and crush pineapple instead.  Maybe that\\'s because I didn\\'t use grape jelly a the recipe call for.  They be good the second day. These be so easy and good. I just throw all of it in the crock pot, stir a couple of time and in a few hour it be ready. The last party I take these to, it be the first thing gone! I have be make this recipe for year and it be always a big hit with any crowd!  I stock up on chili sauce when I see it on sale so I always have it on hand to make for parties.  I also make this in my crockpot with out the pepper. I make use meatball I buy at BJ\\'s, and they be great!  Everyone love them, and a always pig out!  This sauce have a little bite from the cayenne, give it a little bite of an edge over the standard recipe for this, and one that everyone seem to love!  The crock pot be much light go home then when I carry it in!  Thanks for share with us! I have have these lot of time at wed reception and parties, but this be my first time make them myself.  I follow the recipe exactly, except I make my own meatball instead of use frozen.  It\\'s hard to believe that chili sauce and grape jelly combine make a wonderful sauce, but they do!  If you be look for a great appetizer to bring to a party, this be a winner! A try and true favorite that everyone loved.  A definate keeper. I can\\'t believe I\\'d never make these until tonight!  Very, very good & so easy!\\r\\nI use Trader Joe\\'s freeze meatball (little over 1lb package) so I just cut the sauce portion in half & it be perfect - enough yummy sweet/tangy sauce for some noodles!  Even get a thumb up from my choosey 4 year old.  Thanks! I don\\'t understand what everyone love about these. I follow the recipe exactly and they be just OK. They be only even OK b/c I use kittencal\\'s recipe for the meatball and those come out delicious. I\\'ve try a variation on this that I like a lot; it involve use apricot preserve and some mustard. I just didn\\'t care for this combo. I absolutely LOVE this recipe. My family make these for every family gathering, and they be a hit! Great for all ages. This be a wonderful recipe that I have use for years.  I have use Meatballs, Little Smokies and slice Kielbasa , only thing I add be 1 cup Wild Turkey Bourbon but be aware that you need to keep the underage kiddy away from this pot. Great recipe love the ease to prepare to this one!!!  serve this at premier jewelry show and guest enjoy it.\\nthanks I\\'m not really a meatball person, but I\\'d decide that for our most recent bbq I be go to try to make thing easy on myself with super easy recipes.  This one be a huge hit!  I could only find \"italian seasoned\" meatball and think that might change the flavor, but it wasn\\'t noticeable.  I personally would have prefer it a bite spicy, but because there be lot of child I choose to skip the cayenne altogether (sniff).  They be still great, though, and I plan on keep these ingredient on hand for those lazy night when I don\\'t want to cook.  Kittencal, you seriously rock! It wouldn\\'t be grape jelly and chili sauce meat ball if I use cranberries. This be the easy recipe to make if you use pre-made meatballs. So tasty, too! Fabulous for when you need to bring something to a social event but don\\'t have much time-or, if you have a small child who like to brag that they make it. Thank you for post such a great appetizer! I make this for a party. Very easy to make and very good. Thanks for submitting. Very Easy recipe and very tasty. I make these in my crock pot for a carry in. I mix all ingredient in the crock pot then I add already prepare meatball and let it cook on high for 2 hour to heat and meld the ingredient together.  Will use again. Thanks a bunch for a wonderful recipe. I make this for a Thanksgiving appetizer and use little smoke sausages.  It be a snap to put it together!  The ingredient sound strange but the sauce have a very nice flavor! What a quick and easy sauce for meatballs!  I have a potluck to go to and the sauce be a breeze to whip up.  I add some chili pepper flake because even though I follow the direction to a \\'T\\', it seem to have an overpower grape/sweet taste.  Once I toss in a few sprinkle of chili pepper flakes, it zip it right up with a nice bite, but not too hot.  I also add a dash of cayenne use my drop/dash/pinch/tad measure spoons.    I make Recipe #69173 to go with this.  All in all, very good and I will make again. Great recipe, rave review all around.  I do add 1/2 tsp each mince garlic & crush peper flakes.  I\\'ve make it with both the freeze store buy meatball & the suggest meatballs.  It work well both ways, but the suggest meatball be greatly preferred. Thanks for posting! I make this today for my holiday celebration.  People really enjoy them.  I follow the recipe exactly a posted.  I do put the chili sauce and grape jelly in a bowl and microwave it for about 3 minute and take a wisk and mix it.  I put all the meatball in my 6 quart Nesco and pourd the sauce over it and let it cook for 4-5 hours.  Thank you for share your recipe. Made these last night for Christmas Eve and they be a big hit! I microwave the sauce for a few minute until bubbly and then pour over meatball in a crockpot for 2.5 hour on high. Yum! What a great and easy recipe! Made it for a party tonight. It be a big hit. Thanks so much!! I have make this many time before and I be very happy to find it on Zaar. Thank you for posting. I need a quick easy dinner and we just love this. To make it more meal-like I serve it over white rice- then it\\'s just like good ol\\' fashion comfort food! I make these all the time, and they be always a hit!  Wonderful taste! positively the best sauce around- also good with tobasco instead of chili sauce, but either way- try this one! I don\\'t do the pinch of cayenne, and always use this on little smokies- just toss \\'em in a crock pot! I like to make this in the crockpot with the lil\\' smokie sausages.  Its a big hit at party and potlucks.  One of my go-to entertain recipes!   Thanks for posting! These be just like my mom makes...They be absolutely addicting!! i have these year ago at a Compant cocktail party. My bosses\\' wife make them. I love them. Super meatballs. I make them in the crock pot..... on low for about an hour. It be easy to leave them in the crock pot during a get together so they stay warm. I make this use Chili Sauce recipe 52689.  Turned out really good, and best of all, it be quick and easy. I\\'ll be maing this again for sure.  Thanks for posting. I wasn\\'t a fan of these. They come out way too sweet for my tastes. I\\'m not give any star for this recipe because I notice just how much jelly and how much brown sugar be in the recipe for chili sauce #52689 and I alter it to suit us. That be said, I\\'m hop that people like us, that don\\'t desire the sooo sweet taste, will take a suggestion when they see that I give no stars.  I add bbq sauce, cut back the jelly and add more cayenne.  I don\\'t know the quantity...it be add a bit, taste, add a bit, taste until I reach my own personal preference... which be a bite of sweetness, a bite of tanginess, and that afterburn of cayenne.  I make Kittencal\\'s Italian Melt-In-Your-Mouth Meatballs (which be wonderful) along with Lil Smokies and they be great. If I be a fan of such sweetness.....5 star all the way. Wanted to make an appetizer that my 3-1/2 year old twin granddaughter would like a they LOVE meatball of any kind. As it turn out everyone love these, include my son\\'s in-law from Norway. I make them in advance and throw them in a crockpot to keep warm and they be DELICIOUS! Left out the cayene for the whimpy taste bud but would love to try it spicy in the near future! You cannot go wrong with this recipe. It\\'s be a family favorite for year and be a big hit at potlucks, company parties, etc. Just throw the ingredient into the crock pot and let her simmer. I use freeze turkey meatball to make thing even easy -- they have a soft texture than beef. My DM use to make these.  We call them \"Minnie\\'s meatballs\" and she use to serve them all the time.  Thanks for the reminder of an old favorite!! Not like this recipe need any more rave reviews, but here\\'s one more.  I\\'ve be make these for year and they\\'re always a hit.  I do the same thing that supernova mention ... just throw it all into a crockpot and let it simmer away for the day.  Talk about \\'set it and forget it\\' ... it doesn\\'t get any easy than this for a great appetizer A little sweet for my taste, but the family quite like them.  Quite an easy recipe to follow and will make again. Pretty good.  I have never make these before, but have have them many time at get-togethers.  Only thing I didn\\'t like be that the sauce didn\\'t stick well to the meatballs.  I also use my crock-pot to keep them warm throughout the party. Great recipe. I buy jam instead of jelly on accident, but the recipe still turn out fine (and I make both the meatball and aded lil smokies). I make half a recipe for 1 lb. of Smokies.  Loved the flavor and so quick to do.  DH love them with a sour cream and onion chip. These be very good.  I make them in the crockpot and the long they cooked, the good the sauce got.  The sauce really didn\\'t stick to the meatball very well.  I use recipe #69173 for the meatball and they be very good.  This be a tad on the sweet side for us.  I add about 2 tsp of red pepper flake to the sauce to spice it up some.  Thanks Kitz :) These be ok, but a little cloyingly sweet for my taste. Perhaps if some additional spice be put in to balance the grape jelly taste. My aunt do a version of this recipe with currant jelly and ketchup, which I will try sometime, because this one be great!  I do use a couple teaspoon of cornstarch to thicken the sauce at the end, and I serve this a supper, not an appetizer...  Nobody complained! Love this recipe!!!!  My friends/family all look at me funny when I tell them the ingredient but it be a winner at our holiday gatherings.  I follow the recipe exactly and use a mixture of meatball and sausages. Oh, Oh, Oh, so good! We use to make these year ago around the holiday to snack on during gift wrap parties, New Years Eve, and for Super Bowl parties. But sadly, I\\'d forget the ingredients. Thanks for bring back an old favorite! Made these for a family get together on the 4th of July and do they go over like fireworks!!!  I make my own meatball (cocktail size)....5lbs. worth.....and every single meatball be eaten!!  I couldn\\'t have ask for a good outcome!!  Thanks, Kittencal!! These be really good, for the first couple, but too sweet after about 4 or 5 of them. Maybe I\\'ll use le jelly next time. Perfect!  It be just what I be look for.  I use a 3 lb bag of meatball and halve the jelly & chili sauce.  Everyone love them!  Yummm! I have be make these for years.  My Aunt give me the Recipe.  Always a big hit at parties.  This be an appetizer not an man meat dish.  I don\\'t add the pepper and It\\'s very good.  I use Armour meatball find in the freeze meat section of your grocery store.  32 oz jar of Grape Jelly or any jelly really will do.. some use cranberry sauce.  And two jar of chili sauce to one 5 pound bag of meatball be perfect.  Will make about 160 meatballs. By far the BEST meatball ever! I leave out the cayenne pepper...they always disappear on game day get-togethers! I have a cater business in the early 2000\\'s and this be the meatball recipe I would use and everybody love them. I also change up sometimes and use a homemade barbecue sauce. I usually add a tsp or so of crush red pepper to give the meatball a slight kick. This recipe have be around for a long time, but it be stil just a good a ever. I make this exactly a the recipe state and love it.  Such a hit at the SuperBowl party I make them for. So yummy! My husband would like if I serve this for dinner :) I make a batch to bring to a party and before we leave the house he have eat them all! I use this sauce to make \"worms\" for Halloween... slice regular hot dog length-wise into 4 slice and make tiny cut sideways along each piece. When you boil them, they will curl up and look like worms! My mom give me a recipe very similiar to this, but it have lemon in it which cut some of the sweetness. Makes it more sweet and sour. I think about a tablespoon per pound of meat.<br/>Delicious YUMMY so simple an delicious! Delicious !! Made this today for a small crowd of co-workers.. Everyone ask for the recipe. and it be request that I bring this dish to a Luncheon in 2 weeks... So simple and so delicious... I make one small addition, half jar of fresh mild salsa dip and a tiny bite more cayannne pepper .... give it a liitle mild bite ....definately will make over and over. Liked them. I make this sauce with little smokies.... it be great, but I have a difficult time get the sauce to thicken, even when I add cornstarch.  I leave out the spice, but think I would add it next time to give it more of a kick.  I think this be a good dish for meatballs, not smokies. Thank you for this!  I be deperately search for a quick and easy recipe for a sauce to put over my meatballs.  This be super quick and easy.  I only have one jar of chili sauce, therefore I reduce the amount of grape jelly.  I still have plenty of sauce and it be delicious.  I will definitely keep extra grape jelly and chili sauce on hand for the future. I&#039;ve be use the recipe for two year now - it be a crowd pleaser! I make it for football Sundays and everyone love them! This be a large amount to make so be ready for some leftovers.  Thank you! Have be make this for 40 yr when you couldn&#039;t buy pre-made  freeze meatballs.  I now buy Rosina Classic 1/2&quot; cook meatballs.  Even though they be cooked, I put them in a 350 degree oven for about 15 mins. to remove additional grease. &lt;br/&gt;I try make these with the cranberry sauce recipe and they be awful...the cranberry sauce be way too tart!   Ended up throw them out.  Stick to this original recipe! FAB! It be delicious and have a bite of a &#039;retro&#039; feel to it! I serve them in a bowl with toothpicks...It could not be easy to prepare..45 min on the stave and then a couple of hour on low in the crockpot.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks! I do this recipe, but in a crock pot for 4 hour on low. I make this with half lil smokies and half freeze meatball at a company potluck. The meatball be by far fast the first to go, and get the most compliments.  At one point someone ask me what be in the sauce and the room fell quiet while everyone listened!! I admit the two ingredient and then laugh like I be kidding; and everyone laugh along with me.  It do sound incredulous but it&#039;s actually very good. The original recipe be call Jelly Meatballs from the Best of Bridge cookbook.  It have the addition of brown sugar, lemon juice and a small amount of soya sauce. It also have the recipe for the meatball which be perfect a they do not overpower the sauce. This be a go to recipe for appie party and we make the meatball full size for potlucks.  Fav for the guys. Excellent and easy meatball recipe for appetizer or main course.  Everyone love these.  I&#039;ve be make them for year -- get the recipe originally from a Betty Crocker recipe book.  Nobody believe the sauce only have two ingredients. Made these tonight in slow cooker. They be delicious! Easy to make too. I add just a pinch of cayenne pepper to give them a bite of &#039;zip&#039; . I make these the other night to take to my Mom\\'s memory care unit at the local nurse home. I use to make them in the crockpot but I want something quick and this be it! The only bad thing that I do be use freeze meatball (Mama Lucia\\'s mini meatballs) that I purchase at my local grocery store. I will never do that again because my meatball recipe be similar to Kitten\\'s and they taste SO much good than the freeze kind. Since I have room in the pot, I also add 2 pkgs. Wilshire Farms little beef cocktail wieners. This brand be terrible! I will use Armor brand in the future. Everything come out fantastically use this method, but I be really disappoint with myself for not make my own meatball and use Wilshire Farms little smokies.',\n",
       " \" easy to make WOW.  Delicious.  The only change I make be that I mix half the top mixture into the batter then top with the other half.  Will be make this again.  Many, many times. This be delicious!  I make only a couple tiny change - instead of the 3 egg whites, I use 2 whole eggs, I add a bite of cinnamon and nutmeg right to the batter, and I bake it in 2 loaf pan since my 8x8 be dirty!  Will definitely make again! Made for PAC Spring '12.\",\n",
       " ' Loved this dip and I have to make another batch because it be go so quickly.  I slice up baguette and we pile the dip onto the bread slice instead of dip them.  Will definitely be make this often!',\n",
       " \" These bar have a lovely flavor.  They be quite cakey and moist and burst with chocolately and pumpkiny goodness.  Mine take more like 30-35 minute for the first bake so that they be not undo in the middle.  I think next time I might just bake them a bite long and skip the second bake, then cut 'em and dust 'em,\",\n",
       " \" My family and I love this fish! It's sooo easy to make! I'm not a chef, but the way the simple flavor come together, my husband be surprised! We really like this.  I didn't have a thai red pepper so I substitute about 1/2 tsp. of Thai Red Curry paste.  It be not at all spicy.  I serve the fish over rice.  I use Swai, a mild white fish similar to Tilapia. So easy to make with absolutely gorgeous aroma & flavor. I use tilapia fillet & jasmine rice. Thanks Halalmom Great recipe, and very easy to make.  Tastes fresh and light and creamy, with a great depth of flavour than I expect from the simple ingredient list.  I de-seeded and slice the chilli, and use dry Kaffir lime leave because I couldn't get any fresh one (not sure what sort be needed).  We then serve the finish dish with a rather un-Thai Basmati rice and with green salad leaves.  We love it and will be make it again.  It would be a very quick and easy dish for entertaining.  Reviewed for PAC Spring 2007.\",\n",
       " \" I make this a couple of week ago and forgot!!It be a hit with young and old!!Made half recipe and use Feta instead of Chevre.Loved it,will make lots.Thanks. These be wonderful.  I make a small batch for just myself for lunch today and love them.  My store didn't have chevre so I use some blue cheese that I have on hand and need to use up.  Also, I use jar roast red pepper instead of fresh.  I'll definitely make these the next time I need an appetizer for guests.  thank for post the recipe KelBel :) This be wonderful and save dinner for me since my fish I make be so strong I couldn't eat it.  I couldn't find chevre cheese so mix in about 4 oz of grade parmesan with the cream cheese.  For the Garlic Shrimp, I add a sprinkle of Old Bay Seasoning and chop the shrimp before cook so I could get a good coverage over the bread. Used a French Baguette in place of the French bread because the store have just make it fresh. Other than that I follow the direction and make for a wonderful meal.  Thanks so much for posting.  This be a very versital recipe which I really like. This be an excellent finger food, and would fit in well at any party.   Next time I might add a tiny bite more season to the cheese, a I find it a tiny, tiny bite on the bland side.  We DID manage to find the chevre cheese, and maybe that's why.  A lot of people sub parmesan, which I think have a strong flavor.  But this be still absolutely lovely.  My sister couldn't stop eat it.  <3 Yum!  These make fabulous appetizer at our Christmas Eve party.  I substitute shred pizza cheese for the chevre and bake the cream cheese mixture.  Also, instead of use fresh red bell peppers, I use roast red peppers.  Thanks for the recipe! wonderful serve them a an mid afternoon snack and they hit the spot perfectly. I use pre-cooked prawn and reduce the cook time to 2 minutes. Will make this again. thank KelBel This be very easy and tasteful. When I be done, I also pour a little hot sauce on top for a little kick.\",\n",
       " ' So tasty,can,t wait to try it with other fruit,',\n",
       " \" This recipe have be make by our family at Christmas for at least 15 years. My trick for (somewhat quickly) make a double batch: Prepare two 13x9x2 pan and prepare an entire batch of just peanut butter fudge (use the entire two cup of p.b. chips) and divide between the two pans, then do the same with the chocolate portion of the fudge. Homemade fudge take a little time, effort, and patience, but this recipe be SO worth it. I like that this fudge recipe be time rather than have to use a candy thermometer.  Also, I have learn that cane sugar work best for all baking, but most especially when make candy. I've try use beet sugar with this recipe but it come out gritty and didn't quite set up correctly. I find this recipe on the back of a bag of Reese's PB Chips back in the 80's.  I make it every year, at Thanksgiving & Christmas.  It's really foolproof a long a you give the roll boil time. It make enough fudge for 2 party or lot of gifts.\",\n",
       " \" This be great! Coming from a person who isn't really keen on red sauce, or chicken parmesan a a whole-I love it, a do my chicken parm love parents. My parent add a little bite of mozzarella cheese on top of their chicken and we place all the chicken peices under the broiler for about ten minute (five minute each side) to brown them up. I have to bake a little long than specified, take about 50 minute total, to cook the thick peices.\\r\\nSauce be sensational. I dont normally like red sauce because i HATE onions, but this be simple, onion free and delicious. Thank you! Kids love it. Had enough to have for lunch for the next two days. Very nice chicken paresan, we like it a lot.  I make it for Valentine's dinner because of the red sauce which be excellant.  The chicken be lovely and moist with lot of flavour. I use whole wheat spaghetti.  I will make it again.  Thanks for posting. The DH surprise me with this for dinner...I think there be cream in it and be pleasantly surprise to hear there be none! He add a small chop onion and use 1/2 cup 1% milk and 1/2 cup fat free half and half. We have the sauce over pasta with veggie on the side but we be look forward to the try it with the chicken next time! Thanks for posting! Had this for dinner tonite and my son go crazy!  He love it!  He really like the chicken, which come out juicy and taste great with the dijon mustard.  Made the recipe exactly a written.  Will definately make again. Great recipe, especially delicious sauce that I will use often.  Thanks for sharing. Amazing!!! This be soooo good!!! My husband doesnt care for parmesan cheese so I substitued shred Asiago (not to much different but a bite strong in flavor) i also  use 1/2 skim milk and 1/2 fat free  half and half   sooo good, thank  love it!!!, Great recipe as-is and easy to make!\",\n",
       " \" This week's theme on the 'Zaar be meatloaf, and othey have poultry loaves, but no sea food! So, I find this tuna loaf recipe so I have to try it. I'm glad I did! The direction be a bite confuse (Which part of the lemon be I suppose to use? What on earth be I do with the four slice of bread?), so I use fresh spinach (all I had), omit the lemon juice (had no idea how much to really use), and use 1 cup of bread crumbs. It be one sorry excuse for a 'loaf,' but it be a great dinner! Next time, I'm go to add at least 1/2 cup more bread crumb in hop to make it more 'loaf like', maybe some finely chop mushrooms, and top with sour cream. Thank you SO much for sharing!\",\n",

Enjoyed this with a glass of Pinot Noir.  Made for the Aussie Swap #33. Something a simple a this be always my kind of food! Living in France I often find myself with a cheese and bread lunch, especially when I be by myself........however, this be a nice twist on my usual fare. I have no idea what pepitas are, so I go ahead and use Ste. Maure Chevre cheese (goat's cheese), Tomme (hard cow's milk cheese from the SW of France), pumpkin seed ( I have no sunflower seeds!), Ritz cracker and home-made Blackberry Jelly. The combination of the sweet with the salty and the cheese be wonderful. I agree with Susie Cooks, and I may add some olive next time and a handful of almond would also be nice. Made for the Veggie swap #16 and very much enjoy thanks! FT :-) PS. I serve mine on a rustic round wooden bread board! This be excellent, and a great change to buy two (new to me) cheeses. Both be stunning!

One thing I learn the hard way though - some pasta manufacturer now make lasagna noodle that do not need to be precook (softened in the water).  Check the box before you buy!  I accidentally overcook the noodles, they burn a bite and be chewy.  That be my own fault though, and not that of the recipes'.  Thanks, Karamia for share this with us! This be an excellent lasagna recipe.  The only thing I change be I use 1 pound of grind beef and a half pound of grind pork instead of all grind beef.  The one problem I have be that it start get a little too do around the edge before the center be cooked.  The top be also start to dry out.  Next time I'll cook it at 350Â° and just bake it a little bite longer.  I'll also keep it cover for about the first 20 minute or so, or at least until the center start to cook. This be my favorite lasagna recipe.  I saw it on another site about 3 year ago and make it.  It become a staple of my cook books.  I be go to post it here, but find that someone else already had.  Thanks!  Give this one a try, you won't be disappointed. Sorry Guys but not impress with this recipe.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Here be the reason why.  - The ricotta and egg when bake turn out more like and omelette compare to a nice creamy sauce.   The meat sauce be mediocre and certainly not one I would have make normally, don&#039;t quite see the need for the sugar.  -   After taste and make enough for six and hop to use this for a few night will eat once and that will be it, and thats purely because I didn&#039;t buy anything else for dinner.   Very Disappointed. Delicious! The whole family love it! Thank you for the recipe! I don&#039;t think this work Delicious lasagna--both meaty and cheesy. Well season sauce. Makes a ton.\",\n",

I just finish make these to go with tomorrow's Easter ham dinner, and they be so delicious that I couldn't wait to write the review. I don't even like carrots, but these I like.  They're sweet and will go perfectly with the ham.  The recipe call for 1 kg of carrot -- that's about 2.2 lb for those of you who don't know (I use an even 2 lbs).  I double the butter and sugar (by accident - but it didn't hurt) and bring it to a nice brown caramel color before toss in the carrots;  I didn't add the salt and pepper, but they didn't need it. I find this recipe to make for Christmas Eve for our German best friends. Lo and behold they hate carrots! HOWEVER they love this so much that they have ask I make it for Easter! I modify this process by caramelize the sugar and butter in a deep bake dish in the oven set at 350 for about 15 minutes. On the stave top I heat the broth, add the pepper and whisk the cream then add that to the bake dish with the carrot and bake for another 30 minutes. It save some time, and when you have a a 7 year old, every minute save be a blessing. This be simply delicious. Thank you for this fantastic recipe! We really like these.

I reduce the saturate fat to about 4 gram per serve by use 1/4 cup extra virgin olive oil and skim milk instead of the whole milk and cream.  I also use an entire pound of freeze chop spinach and some grate carrot to increase the veggies.  (I have to use more flour to compensate for the extra liquid release by the spinach.) Thanks for posting! This come together surprisingly fast. I use cheese ravioli. All I have be regular dice tomatoes, so I saute a little onion & garlic in olive oil, then add the tomatoes, etc. I also use all skim milk instead of heavy cream, and my sauce be a little thin b/c of it. This have a really great flavor and definitely be fancier-seeming than our usual weeknight fare. I serve with a Caesar salad and some whole-wheat baguette slices. I like quick meal on Fridays when I have to work late, and this fit the bill.  I have to sub meat tortellini, personal preference, and use two packages.

Delicious - thanks! I can\\'t say I love this recipe, but my kid and their friend rave about it and ask for it frequently. On the plus side, it\\'s easy and cheap, and I love the name. On the minus side, it can\\'t possibly be good for you. I\\'m give it 5 star because of the reaction of my \"audience.\" Excellent!

Friends aren\\'t crazy about overly spicy things, so I sub some of my home-canned mild salsa for the hot sauce.  I do add the entire can of dice green chilies, though.  The sour cream really bring the flavor together and finish the dip.  We serve with corn chips, but plan on spread the few leftover into flour tortilla to make burritos.  Yum!

It\\'s also simple to make and easy to bring to parties.  Thanks for sharing! What a great dip!  I make some changes.  I didn&#039;t have any green chilies so I substitute salsa.  I think this addition make a big improvement because the end result be more dip like, it wasn&#039;t too thick.  Instead of use hot sauce, I use some mild taco sauce.  The dip remind me of a Burrito Supreme from Taco Bell.  I think the dip a I make it would be perfect if I put it in the oven top with cheese for about 15 minutes, and then top it with green onions. This be one of the most offensive name I&#039;ve see refer to Mexican or Mexican-inspired food. How could this website even allow such a thing?

I use fast rise yeast and it also didnt rise too much so i dont think the type of yeast make the different. The only thing I didnt like be the sweet taste, it rather overpowering. I will cut the amount of sugar into half next time. I use dark brown organic sugar. I follow the recipe and find it very sticky a well.  I do add some savory item (sundried tomato and rosemary).

       " \" By a miracle, find a couple of nice peaches--the last of the season, I guess--what a lovely end this be to a spicy Moroccan meal.  Perfect complement--thanks, Caroline! Well I confess to cheat a bite here: I make this with can peaches, so that my preparation time be about 2 minutes, and it be still scrumptious!  I’ll keep this recipe in mind for summer, when I plan to try it with peach and with nectarine and I’ll serve it with Fairy Nuff’s Persian Cream Recipe #134660.  Thanks for post this one, Caroline! Never have I work so hard for such a simple dish.  October be a dreadful time to go look for peaches. After hit 6 or 7 markets, I settle on some nectarines.  Begin prepare the dish and learn that the fine skin of nectarine do not peel the way a peach does.  After a few contortions, I finally have my slices. Whew! The good news be once sampled, I quickly decide it be well worth the effort. The rise water marry perfectly with the fruit and by far exceed all of my expectations. Sublime, really.    Made mine with Splenda to make it WW Core.  Thanks Caroline!\\r\\n I’ll have to try this with some homemade rise water...The rise water I find at the store be pretty bad... How lucky I be to have discover this lovely recipe.  I have access to wonderful fruit here in Greece and amaze rise water.  This recipe use them both to best advantage and just reinforce a firm belief of mine that it be the simple thing in life that be the most delicious.  The mint leave be a must!  A keeper. What a simple and cleanse dessert this be after a large Moroccan feast.  As fresh peach be just out of season, I also use drain can peach and they be just devine.  All my guest want the recipe. This be sooo simple and quick to make. You can't go wrong Such a simple and tasty recipe.  I think my rosewater probably be not a great one a I think the fragrance and taste be too cloying, but despite that this be a lovely way to add a little something extra to peaches. What a lovely recipe with simple ingredient and an elegant flavor!  I will make these regularly, I'm sure.  Frozen slice peach make it easy and available all year round!

       " \" What a great biscuit recipe. I make a state except I add 2 tsp more sugar and about 1 t cinnamon. These rise up very nicely and be wonderful serve a a base for strawberry shortcakes. WOW, I think I have a new biscuit recipe. Mine didn't brown a much a I would have like (even at 25 min in the oven) but they be completely bake if pale. Delightfully light, fluffy and delicious they will be great for any meal. I use them for lunch in Recipe #331847. The extra time to make be more than worth it. I use no sweeten at all and that may have be a contribute factor in the lack of browning. I use all whole wheat flour and they be still good!  I top mine with some butter and Raspberry jelly.  YUM! I generally would make my biscuit with butter and milk but for various reason I need a vegan version.  Considering the ingredient I would give these biscuit 5  stars.  This recipe be more than perfect if you need vegan whole wheat biscuit and be not a fan of soy milk.  Compared to butter and milk biscuit I would probably rate them 4.75 stars.  They taste almost a good, but who doesn't love butter.  An excellent biscuit all around.  I like forward to try this recipe in the future substitute butter for the oil. I'm sure it's me, because I'm a lousy baker... but mine barely rise at all & be very dry.  I'll be try them again because they be certainly healthy & they taste ok, but so far it seem that I must have do something wrong.  Also, they're more like bread (due to the yeast, I'd guess) than biscuits. Worked well a a biscuit top for Biscuit Topped Chicken Casserole (#38838).\",\n",

The only thing I'd change be next time I'm go to reduce the salt or maybe leave it out altogether since there's salt in the soup, cracker crumb and butter, and it be a tad bite salty.

The only  deviation I make be to spray the coat chicken with my olive oil mister. Thanks for a delicious dinner. I will definitely make this again. Made this tonight and it be absolutely delicious. Just add some breadcrumb to the mix and a little paprika. Green mean and mash potatoes. He love it and be look for more.',\n",

I do reduce the water to either 1/2 or 3/4 depend on the moisture in the apple I be using. I also reduce the sugar to 3 cups. I use golden raisin and that make the whole dish have a great yellow color. Will def make again!',\n",
       " ' i love this recipe Great recipe.. not so sweet like a sicky sweet icing\\'d muffin.  Wonderful for on the go breakfast..good cold or hot... Easy and good!!!I add also a handful of raisins. eBeths\\' daughter:\\r\\nI couldn\\'t beleive how good these were! Must try different dark and light of all bran, either way, it taste great! These muffin turn out good.  I double the recipe and add in a cup of raisens.  Will be make again!! Thanks These be a great basic muffin, not too sweet. Really yummy, great with butter. Thank you for post this.  I use this recipe for my basis when make my \"healthy muffins\".  I sub whey protein for 1/4 c. of the flour, I use splenda instead of sugar, a mash banana or a 1/2 cup of can pumpkin be always nice plus some cinnamon for flavor.  I be just think of post this so I don\\'t lose it again and you do it!  Thanks again. On my monthly shop spree I buy two large cereal box that be on promotion. They each come with a small box of all-bran flakes. This be not my usual brand of bran flakes, and I find them to be taste like cardbox. This recipe become ideal for the purpose of use these bad bran-flakes. I time it by three and add a cup of cake mix. A nother bonus be not have to use paper cups, a they come easily out of the pan. Will make again in orded to use the rest of the unused cereal. Always love this one!  I chop up 1 apple and add it in just before place in cups.  Tastes wonderful and be a healthy breakfast for everyone. Pretty good. Not a good a I remember my mom making. Could have be just a touch sweeter. Maybe next time I will add raisin like I saw a few do. Overall, a decent muffin. Thanks for  post this recipe. I be go to definitely play around with it for a bite though.  ;) Wonderful! Made 55 mini muffin - delicious little crispy bites.  Used butter instead of PAM.  Used whip cream instead of milk & oil - have to add 1/4 cup more water with the egg.  A splash of vanilla & a teaspoon of ginger - bake for 17 minute & cool on cookie rack - crispy deliciousness!  Bringing a handful in to early be meet - just the thing instead of stale \"muffins\" offer a breakfast (bringing my own coffee too LOL). Great recipe incorporate All Bran cereal.  Healthy and delicious!!!<br/>Made for ZaarStars~ This make delicious muffins.  I substitute spenda for the sugar and add 1/2 c of unsweetened applesauce.  Splenda be a wonderful product - but it do not add the moistness that you get from sugar so I think it\\'s important to add that back in.  Pumpkin or banana would be good too. I love this recipe!!!  I make these every few day and eat 2 mini muffin every morning!! Great source of fiber!! I do add a banana to the recipe or raisin once in a while, but i love them plain a well!!!! Not super sweet, just perfect. I substitute 2 cup of unsweetened applesauce for the milk in this recipe. Add 1/2 tsp cinnamon and raisins. Great muffins!! Although this be very good, it isn&#039;t really the original recipe that appear on Nabisco bran cereal box before the late 70 or early 80s, and I think that be what many of u remember when we think of our mother&#039;s recipes.  I still have the original, which I will place here. If this one doesn&#039;t taste like what you remember, try the early one. You can substitute Kellogg&#039;s All Bran for the Nabisco cereal. I think this one be good because of the brown sugar.&lt;br/&gt;1 Egg&lt;br/&gt;1 c milk&lt;br/&gt;3 Tbsp vegetable oil&lt;br/&gt;1-1/2 cup Nabisco 100% Bran Cereal&lt;br/&gt;1 c sift all purpose flour&lt;br/&gt;2 - 1/2 tsp bake powder&lt;br/&gt;1/2 tsp salt&lt;br/&gt;1/4 cup light brown sugar, firmly packed&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Beat first three ingredients. Stir in cereal and let stand 5 min (or longer). Sift together flour, bake powder, and salt.  Blend in sugar.  Add bran mixture, stir just until combined, do not overmix.  Fille grease muffin tin 2/3 full. Bake at 400 degree for 18 - 20 mins. Makes 12  2-1/2 muffins. These be the way I remember the Kellogg&#039;s Bran Muffin being! (NOT the Nabisco recipe which be a sweet muffin).  I love these because they be not so sweet and have a wonderful bran taste/smell.  Brings me back to my childhood when my mom would make these for u kids. Today&#039;s typical muffin contain too much sugar IMO so these be awesome little sweet but not too much. (now if only I can find a way to make them gluten free lol).... Used to make this recipe back in the middle 80&#039;s.  So happy to find this again.  It be on the All Bran cereal box back then but have not be on there since.  All the other bran muffin recipe don&#039;t have you soak the bran in the milk for half an hour.  That be how I know this be the recipe I have lost.  Made this the muffin today and ... oh my .... they be the best! Thank you Dienia B for post this recipe. You can make these gluten free by sub brown rice or oat flour for the all purpose. They come out great I have enjoy these muffin since I be a little girl. My mother make them all the time a an afterschool snack. I never know they be HEALTHY until I be an adult. She alter the recipe a bite by change out 1/2 cup of the AllBran for Grapenuts. LOVE THESE.  Can add slice apple or raisin too. Added a Banana with bran milk and egg mix and also use self raise flour instead of plain and bake powder.  Very moist tasty muffins.  Only take 15 min 200deg Celsius. I be go to add one mash banana, raisons and honey to this recipe :) I make these a bite healthy by substitute a 4 oz container of apricot-apple sauce for the oil and unsweetened vanilla almond milk for the milk; I add 1/2 cup molasses for flavor and iron. I smear virgin coconut oil in the tin so the muffin wouldn&#039;t stick. I also add chocolate chip to some of them (for my 3 year old). Using mini muffin tins, they be do after 15 minute at 400 degrees. DELICIOUS! Sooooooooooo yummy !!! Very Delicious. I cut the prep. time in half by shop my bran flake up in the food processor, then add them to the milk. The batter be very thick, and it make thick muffins. I would prefer a lighter, airy muffin, but these be okay. Adding a half cup or so of raspberry make them amazing!!!!! I make these yesterday and like them very much.  JUst like i remember them year ago.  I make buttermilk with 1 tbl lemon juice with 2 &amp; milk.   Thanks for the recipe again. Good tasting...you can sub bran bud easily or do some wheat flour sub...I always add blueberry or even good small wild huckleberries...a little extra sugar help bring out the sweetness of the berries. Super yummy! I add cinnamon and raisins. It\\'s really flavorful with those additions! These turn out flavorless. I eat two and my hubby eat 1/2 of one and we toss the rest. I use store brand bran cereal because they didn\\'t carry the All-Bran brand. It look comparable so I think it be this recipe but it could have be the cereal that be the problem. I\\'ve be make the All Bran muffin for over 40 years. Adding 2 cup of date and a cup of walnut make these fabulous.',\n",
       " ' I love this recipe especially because I can\\'t make a pie crust for the life of me and also it be so quick and easy.  I do double the sugar (our apple be very tart right now) and the cinnamon a I like a lot of cinnamon in my apple pie.  This be the best usually pie make be save for the weekend but this one can be do after work while your eat dinner thank you for share it our new favorite I don\\'t make pie very often because I hate roll out pie crust. This pie be the answer to my prayers. We think be be delicious and very homey tasting. The cinnamon amount be just right. Thanks for share a great recipe. My dad have be ask for an apple pie for the past coupla weeks. I find this recipe and just have to try it. Very easy to make. I follow the recipe exactly and it turn out really well. About the only thing that I would do differently would be to coat all of the apple with the sugar/cinnamon mix before put in the pie pan instead of just sprinkle it on top. My dad really like it, but say that it be a little dry (he can always find something to complain about) but that might have be due to the type of apple that we use in the pie. This one be a keeper in my book, thank you marie!!!!! I REALLY enjoy this recipe and so do my family. I make this to take to my parent house. I need something easy and fairly quick to make. I reduce the butter to 1/2 a cup (1 stick) so the crust batter be not pourable, so I spoon it over the apple mixture. I also put in 2 tablespoon each of the sugar and cinnamon. My apple be pretty tart since they be very early. This recipe be very good and I like that the crust stay on the top. We serve it with vanilla bean icecream and love every minute of it.  This be simple to make and very delicious!  Kind of a cross between apple pie and apple cake.  Thanks for post the recipe! Made this a couple of night ago with some apple that be a little past their use by date. It be so yummy of coures I add some extra pecans, because I like the crunch.We serve it with a little cream. I think I might try the \"crust\" over some pear next time. It be quick and easy this be devine. Marie Thank you thank you thank you Bella  Changing my review to add that extra star - I think I be go to make this again tonight!  The chef get back to me and explain my ignorance of what a \"deep dish pie\" is.  I didn\\'t even know that a WHOLE subcategory of pie with only top crust exist!  \\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'m not sure I make this right because the crust be on top. For some reason, I be think it be suppose to sink to the bottom, like one of those Bisquik recipes. Except for that confusion, this be a great recipe. The topping/crust taste kind of like a sugar cookie, but better. And the apple have the perfect amount of spice (I do add a little nutmeg, but that\\'s just me...the total of the nutmeg/cinnamon mixture be 1 tablespoon). Unfortuneatly, I be out of pecans, but I be imagine the whole time how tasty it would be to have them in the crust! So, four star on this for now - base only on the lack of clarity in the recipe, NOT TASTE - TASTE IS GREAT; if the whole \"where do the crust go\" confusion get clear up...5 stars!\\r\\n Fabulously yummy sum this up! A must for your fall baking.  I follow recipe to a T and it be perfect!  Will make again! This recipe be fantastic!  It\\'s not exactly a pie, more like a cobbler, but nevertheless it be super easy and taste wonderful.  I add about 2 more tablespoon of sugar with the cinnamon because I use granny smith apples, my favorite for pies. EXCELLENT!!! and so easy to prepare.  I make it and serve it to my family last evening.  One ask for second which finish off the pie!  My daughter be make it for her women\\'s group next week.  It\\'s a nice change from the traditional apple pie but with all the flavor and more.  It\\'s a keeper in my recipe file.  I can\\'t wait to make it for my friend in Florida soon.  Thanks for post it.\\r\\nPeppy W. -Rochester, New York This be easy to make, but wasn\\'t a good a I be expect after all the rave reviwes.  It be good, and simple. A great fall dessert!  This be easy to prepare and very good.  I use granny smith and gala apple and make it in an 8x8 square bake dish. I really like the cinnamon flavor. I make this recipe twice.  The 2nd time around I use 5 red apple and a deep dish 9\" pie pan, which make the pie taste more like an old-fashioned apple pie.  This recipe taste much good than apple crisp/crumble.   Delicious!   Only change be to up the sugar a bite and double the cinnamon because we love it so.  Everyone love it.  Thanks! This be a wonderful recipe, Marie. I use apple I already have on hand - 2 Jonagolds & 2 Fujis.  I use the amount of sugar & cinnamon list & intend to add 1/4 tsp. nutmeg to that mixture, mistakenly add it to the flour/egg/sugar topping.  Didn\\'t hurt it one bit!  With my nifty Pampered Chef apple/peeler/corer, the prep time be cut at least in half (forgot to time it).  As another reviewer suggested, this would make a good dessert use pear or I would like to try it with peaches.  I\\'ll definitely make this again. I make this pie this afternoon and what a treat, I have so many apple to use up and what a great way to do it.  Tahnks for posting. This be unbelievably good. I have trouble keep the top 2\" from the sides, and I think I would end up with pie all over the oven, but NO! In 1 hour it be cook to perfection.....a new favourite in this house! I use Granny Smith apple and do not change any of the other ingredients.  I serve it with cinnamon ice cream.  I wasn\\'t sure what to expect, but the flavor be good, and I will probably make it again sometime.  It be simple, it go together fairly quickly, and it have good flavor; but my personal preference would still probably be for a traditional pie. Really easy and you get that apple pie taste. I\\'d never make a pie crust, so this be a keeper. I take the suggestion of another reviewer and toss the apple with the cinnamon and suger to get the flavor throughout. For some reason, my batter wasn\\'t pourable (needed to spoon it on) but it come out great anyway. This be a easy, tasty dessert. My husband love it warm. It be more like a cobbler then a pie, but it be worth bake for sure. Very Yummy! I will make it again for sure. Marie, Marie- What do you do to me?? Haven\\'t be out of the kitchen since I find your recipe! As soon a one pie be eaten, my husband request another one! ;-) Thanks! For u pie-crust-challenged folk, this recipe be a dream come true. My apple-pie-addicted DH scarf his down pretty quick. I love the pecans. I sub 1/4 c br sugar and 1/4 c sucanat for 1/2 c of the sugar. It be sweet than regular apple pie. I use 6 spartan and could have use a few more; the crust seem so thick in the middle. Can\\'t wait for breakfast to finish the leftovers--unless DH beat me to it. This do not WOW me a much a I be hop for after read all the rave reviews. I have to make the top twice a the first batch do not come out very \"pourable\" I be afraid it be too stiff, so I whip it up a second time, it come out good but be still somewhat thick than what I be expecting. I still go ahead and it bake up fine, a little hard and crunchier than I expect around the edges. It have a good flavour though,that I find to be much good the next day. Could be that I set my sight too high a I be not a very accomplish pie crust maker either, and maybe be expect the top to be more crust like than it was. Could be that I be a big fan of apple crisp too, which I whip up quite often, and find just a easy to put together. Thanks though Marie, I be glad I try it and it would be a good stand by dessert when you need something quick. I would like to update my review, with regard to a substitution I made.   When double or triple the recipe, I use 1/4 cup of mayonnaise per egg, to replace up to half of the eggs.  The crust come out much more flaky and piecrust-y than use only eggs.  Really a good replacement!  I love this recipe, and find it even good when I use the mayo along with the egg.  I have quadruple this recipe and bake it in a very large pan in the school kitchen, and it come out great!   I make this, but the top be not pourable at all, and I have to spread it over the apples. It come out too hard, and I guess because I prefer flaky crusts, I be somewhat disappointed.  As mention in another review, I think the addition of mayonaise would greatly improve the crust. Absolutely my new favorite way to use up apples!  Moist, cinnamony and delicious - perfection with a scoop of Blue Bell homemade vanilla!  I do add 1/4 c. real mayo to this recipe however, per the advise of other reviewer - certainly be wonderful with it - can\\'t vouch for without. Boy! where do I go wrong???  I have such high hop for this recipe, give the stellar review it have gotten.  I follow the direction to a \"t\"...however, the mixture that go on top of the apple have to sit for about 30 minute after combining...due to circumstance that be out of my control.  Could this possibly have alter everything?  The outcome be that the apple stay on the bottom, and the creamy mixture stay on the top and get crispy.  Like a big glob.  I\\'m so sorry Marie.  I\\'m sure it be something I did.  I will try it again.  I\\'ll hopefully have good luck next time! This be very good.  I use brown sugar instead of white sugar.  The crust be a little too crunchy to my taste.  Could it be due to the sugar switch?  I will for sure make this again ... great way to use your apples! We enjoy this one a lot.  The wealth of good apple this year have u try new recipes.  This so far have the vote.  I cut the butter back to 1/2 cup and forget the nuts.  DH say he like that it be not only moist, but top be softer, not dry or too crunchy.  I use my glass deep dish pie plate, and a good 3/4 of Granny Smith\\'s.  Very good Marie.  Thanks for posting. LOVED THIS!!  Really easy.  Made with fresh pick tart apple from our yard.  I didn\\'t have any pecan so I use cashews, YUM!!!This one\\'s a keeper!! This be our new favorite apple pie! I can\\'t give it the full five, because my husband burn the top just a little.\\nBut under his mistake, be an almost cake like dessert.  It remind me me more of a coffee cake.  I have some chill the next day for a quick breakfast.  It be good then. Another winner, Marie!  I make it just a direct and it be very good.  I have a few anxious moment when it look like it would overflow in the oven but all be well.  Very quick and easy.  Thanks for posting......Janet Enjoyed this so much, Marie!  I make a directed.  Next time may add additional sugar a we have a sweet tooth ~ Thank you! Oh wow! This make a delicious dessert! I use 4 Golden Delicious apples, because it\\'s what I have on hand, whole wheat flour and Splenda for the same reason and didn\\'t have any nut so they be omitted. I make the crust and screw it up, but DH get it to turn out perfectly - even with our substitutions. Wonderful by itself or with vanilla freeze yogurt. I have use this several times. I have a pamper chef apple peeler/corer, so I can whip this up in no time. We LOVE it and everyone always ask for the recipe. I use brown sugar with the cinnamon and always leave out nuts, due to allergy of my good friends. Thanks, Marie. I try this recipe to make for company come and everyone love it!  We have with scoop of vanilla ice cream, and it be eat with much pleasure.  It will be make again soon.  Thank you for share it with us! I make this pie for my dad and he say it be deeeeelicious!  It be really easy to make and turn out quite similar to a cobbler.  It make the house smell amaze while it be cook too.  I do not use the nut a DBF be allergic to walnut so I try not to keep them around and I do not have pecans.  Next time I will try it with the pecans.  Thanks for posting, I\\'ll definitely be make again! Served with ice cream this be one winner of a pie!  We love the crust and so easy to make too! I use the bake \"with it own crust\" idea to make a blueberry pie... thanks! I will be try this recipe soon too! This work out really great! I make a few changes. I cut down the amount of butter to only a 1/2 cup, but a be say earlier, the batter be no long pourable, and you must use a spoon instead. I also cut down the sugar. I have decide that for my family 2/3 c brown sugar work best. Finally I use whole wheat pastry flour, and add 1/4 of flax seed and oat bran for an extra booster. My dish be ready after only  35-40 minute though! Follow-up: \\r\\n     Been make this many time now and find a few thing that I like to do and maybe you will to. I sautee my pecan in butter first, it really help to bring out the flavor, I also \"top\" the batter with them and they stay extra crunchy. \\r\\n     I use quite a lot of apples, each time I use a little more and I have yet to be sorry. I do use a little more of the sugar & cinnamon.\\r\\n     I so love this pie!! This pie be fantastic!  We absolutely love the topping.  It  be so easy to make.  Thanks for post such a wonderful pie recipe. This be not bad. I use only 1/2 butter and 1/2 cup pack brown sugar. Tasted good with whip cream. I also add 1/2 blueberry pie fill to make it apple-blueberry pie. This recipe be delicious and the best part about it, no need to make that annoy pie crust! I make this right before dinner and it be all bake and ready to eat afterwards. Although I must say mine come out more of a cobbler bc the crust stay more on top but it be still a recipe I wouldn\\'t pas up. I make this pie tonight a a test run to determine if it&#039;s worthy of make it to my Thanksgiving dessert bar this year.  I don&#039;t do pie for the same reason post by many other reviewer --- make and work with crust be just not something I do well.  I&#039;m please to say that the pie be delicious and will definitely be serve at my family dinner next week.  The only change I&#039;ll make for my 2nd try will be to increase the sugar and cinnamon.  I use 5 red delicious apple which be on the sweet side but 2 tablespoon each of sugar and cinnamon didn&#039;t sweeten the pie enough for me. I think 3 tablespoon each will be better. I might even add a little brown sugar to the crust mix.  I love how the crust be both crispy around the edge but ooey gooey in the middle.',\n",
       " \" I have serve this at wine taste and block party and every piece get eat every time! I serve this at a gourmet dinner and receive rave review from all. very easy to do- This one a keeper. The only problem be I never could find pear preserves. I serve them with apricot preserves- I would also consider lingonberries. Everyone absolutely love this.  Had trouble find the pear preserves, and when I do find it, it be double the price on other preserve available.  Would consider use orange marmalade or, a another reviewer said, perhaps apricot presrves or lingonberries. This recipe be excellent.  Instead of pear preserves, I caramelize onions.  It be delicious! Love Love Love this recipe.  I have serve it a number of time and it always get amaze reviews.  While I agree the pear preserve be pricey, this recipe totally rock and I would recommend try them.  Thanks so much for posting. So easy and so gourmet tasting; a very elegant appetizer.  Like some of the other reviewers, I use apricot preserve because I could not find pear preserves. I love this recipe - for those who can't find pear preserve - just buy a can of can pear - mash and cook down with a bite of sugar until thick like a preserve or compote - I've make this a dozen time or more and it always work like a charm - For parties, when I want to be able to pas the quesadilla a an appetizer - I put the pecans, harvarti and pear mixture all in the tortilla before toast  -  cool a minute then cut into serve piece - for a cheap version use queso cheese instead of havarti - melt nicely and be pretty good\",\n",
       " ' This be really quite quick to make and I used\\r\\nfreshly-cooked BC raspberries.  This raspberry\\r\\nsauce be make with some sugar and cornstarch\\r\\nand be so tasty instead of use jam preserves.\\r\\nCertainly would make again for very special\\r\\ncompany!! I make this cake use strawberry preserve just for a change - the result be wonderful -- a terrific coffee cake -- many thanks.  This be definitely a 5-star coffee cake. I have make this over and over again and it\\'s always a hit. I have also use light cream cheese with no difficulties. It\\'s great serve warm or cold! Oh, wow... this one\\'s great.  I make it with black raspberry jelly, a little le than the recipe call for since it be all I have on hand.  Turned out fantastic! Quite possibly the best coffeecake I\\'ve ever had! NOT dry, but not overly cake-y, either. The cheese part be not overwhelm and it really be a coffeecake with a thin cream cheesy accent. Topping be great, almond give it that extra YUM! Great for afternoon garden party, or a yummy breakfast snack. I also find this same recipe in the newpaper a few year ago.  I\\'ve make it many time and it be always well-loved by everyone. Podabo, this cake be wonderful! what a delicious buttery moist taste cake this is, with a hint of almond flavor. I don\\'t for the life of me know why I add 1 tsp bake powder instead of 1/2 tsp, I think because most cake recipe call for 1 tsp, but it turn out great anyway, and rise nice and high. This cake recipe will now be place in my favorite and I will make it again, this be a keeper for sure, wonderful cake recipe! Podabo, thank you for sharing...Kittencal:) I be go to post this very same recipe after make it this morning! I find it in my Pillsbury Baking book and think it look very yummy - and I be right! I bake this in a 9 in. pie plate a my springform pan be still pack somewhere and I use homemade huckleberry jam instead of raspberry (since that\\'s what I have open). Oh, and I didn\\'t have any almond extract so I use vanilla. It turn out great! The combination of the moist cake, the creamy cream cheese layer, the fruity jam and the almond be really quite decadent without be overly sweet. With a glass of cold milk, this be perfect on a cold winter morning!  Thanks for post the recipe, podapo! I make this for an Easter brunch this past weekend and it be delicious and beautiful! My oven may be a little on the warm side, but at 350 degrees, it be do perfectly at 40 minutes. Thanks for a great recipe! This coffeecake be so delicious. Tastes good than one you\\'d get in a bakery!!! I use a bite extra raspberry jam a I didn\\'t think it be quite enough for my taste.  Awesome!!!! I turn these into muffin because I have to supply muffin for breakfast for 50, and I be tire of the same old same old.  They be a little time consuming, but delicious and very different. Great cake, love by all who taste it. Thank you for sharing! I make this for an office anniversary party and felt like a queen from all the compliments!  I make a write except that I use a whole, 10-oz. jar of seedless raspberry jam.  It be a little hard to spread and I end up kind of swirl it into the cream cheese, which be just fine.  It\\'s a pretty cake too and fun to make.  I\\'m definitely make this again....thanks so much Donna for another great recipe :) My parent drop in for an overnight visit, leave me scramble for breakfast plans.  I find this recipe and be sure glad I did.  It be very simple to make and impress my mother...a feat all it own.  I do substitute strawberry jam for the raspberry jam, vanilla for the almond extract and chop pecan for the almonds, due to my ingredient on hand.  It be fantastic! Very rich and moist, it be a perfect complement to a bold cup of coffee. My husband and I make this together one Sunday morning.  We follow the recipe exactly.  It turn out great and everyone love it!  What be leave of it be good the next day.  Thanks! Beautiful coffee cake, so easy. I be blush at the compliments. Finally have to tell them  the recipe be yours. I think about 10 lady make this , on Saturday. I didn\\'t have enough sour cream just a half a cup or so, add 1/4 c soften butter  , It still taste GRREAT !\\r\\nThanks Debbie Wow! This be easy to make, but have amaze taste and make a beautiful presentation. I do add more rasberry preserve and a bite more cream cheese.  Thank you Donna for the recipe! I cannot personally attest to the taste of this coffee cake, because it be go before I get any!  Little do my guest know, I use low fat sour cream, fat free cream cheese and egg beater - still must have taste ok!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for the great recipe! I find the very same recipe on another bake website and try it with great success! It be a fabulous recipe that produce a light, delicious cake. I\\'ve make it with apricot, strawberry and blueberry preserve (at different times). It look professionally make and taste so yummy. Great recipe to make if you want to impress someone. Definately one of my favorite recipe of all time! Thanks for post it! PS-I do step 4 in a food processor to speed thing up.

Great flavor and easy to make, I will keep this recipe in my permanent files!! Very IMPRESSIVE! 5* be not enough! This be easy to make and it  look magnificent. I cannot imagine I will be disappoint when I serve it up tomorrow for a lady coffee.\\nI use vanilla extract a I be not a fan of almond extract. I also use more raspberry preserve cuz I LOVE \\'em! I will be post a photo ASAP.Thanks a bunch for post this gem Donna M.! UPDATE! This be OUT OF THIS WORLD Delicious! Looks gorgeous.  I use seedless blackberry jam and it be delicious.  I have trouble tell if it be do and end up take it out right at 55 minutes, but I think it could have use another few minutes.  That may have be due to my use a 9-inch versus 10-inch spring form pan.  Next time (and there will be a next time) I will leave it in a few more minutes.  It look like it come from a bakery and be really quite delicious.  I agree with other reviewers... this be super easy to make! This be lovely and taste great.  I might try just a bite more jam next time, maybe even experiment with fresh fruit mixtures.  Thanks for sharing! I make use raspberry preserve and it be a huge hit!  I make it when my DS and his family would be with us, and we have it for breakfast with coffee and hot cocoa!  The kid love it a much a the adult and they fight over the last piece.  Christmas day be extra special with this on our breakfast menu to start the day! The presentation of this cake be awesome. I use self rise flour and omit the bake powder, bake soda and salt. I use strawberry preserves. This be one of the pretty cake I have ever make and it taste a good a it looks. Definitely a keeper. Impressive coffee cake, that would please anyone.  It take some effort in the preparation but it be worth it.  I make 2 - one with apricot jam and one with raspberry jam and both be delicious.  I\\'m think about try some sour cherry preserve next time - the possibility be endless.  Thanks for sharing! Fabulous!  My daughter\\'s new favorite coffeecake! Amazing!  I make this without the almond and it be sooo good!  Definitely my new favorite coffee cake! This cake turn out very well. It be much easy to make than expected. I heat the strawberry preserve in the microwave for about 30 second which make them much easy to spread over the cream cheese layer. While I love nut on thing the rest of the family can be finicky about what get nut and what doesn\\'t so the next time I will leave them off.  (30) Beautiful cake.. beautifully presented. Makes a wonderful gift or take along to dinners, breakfasts, etc. because it look and taste so good. I make only a couple of minor tweaks:  add 1 tsp vanilla to the cream cheese mixture and add 1 tsp cinnamon to the crumb reserve for the top of the cake.  Very lightly sprinkle the cool cake with confectioner sugar for a nice finish touch.<br/>FYI We have an abundance of wild blackberry at the farm. I cook them down with sugar until they be thicken and use them in place of the preserves--fantastic! I bet one could do this with nearly any fruit. I think I may try peach next a they be in season now.  Also, I have bake it in both 9 and 10 inch springform pan.  It work best in the 10 inch pan and bake at the time specified. It take much long in the 9 inch pan and even overcook the cake a little to get the fill to set. Still, it be delicious and every last crumb disappeared. Thanks for this recipe. It\\'s a keeper! I love this coffee cake!  It be like a big cream cheese pastry and with the spring form pan, look like I purchase it rather than make it.<br/>It be delicious and although it take a little time to prepare, it be well worth the time!  I use my homemade strawberry jam a the fruit, and it make it perfect!<br/>For a beautiful, professional look coffee cake, this be the one! This be really good! I didn\\'t see any review about make ahead of time so I take a chance and make a direct except for put on the streusel top and baking. I just cover with foil and refrigerate over night. This morning at 5:00 be top with the streusel and baked, it turn out beautifully! My mom\\'s caregiver walk in and say OMG what smell so good. So good warm from the oven. Made exact except for almond extract, I just don\\'t like it so I sub vanilla. I have a little trouble spread the dough, I try spread with a fork, then butter my hands, then sugar my hands. Any hints? Other than that easy recipe to follow. I will make again try different variation of preserve & fruits. Great recipe. Thank you! Sorry (: - I can\\'t believe I haven\\'t review this recipe. Most of all, that I haven\\'t let you know how much we love the cake, how it orginally save my life. I have already make something for a \"Family Shindig\" and be ask at the last second to bring a cake.  DH want me to deal with our over load of blueberries. Having all, I choose your recipe. It wasn\\'t just a success, but, be receive with great review and request for the recipe. I have make it with other berry and apple too. This review be realy a \"Thank You\" for a great recipe that be a much love keeper. I be so glad we try this one!  As other reviewer have said, this cake be beautiful.  I make this a direct with the strawberry preserves.  It taste great!  I can see where one could add or change the seasonings, extracts, nut or vary the preserve to make a myriad of variation and I be certain they would all be tasty.  I will certainly be make this again! Wow, this be very good and moist and so beautiful.  Would be great for a brunch where you&#039;re try to impress! This have to be one of the best desert I have ever made! I did\\'t have raspberry preserve so I just cook up some of my freeze strawberry and put them through the blender. Yummy!',\n",
       " ' I like this a lot, though it\\'s quite different from other salad I\\'ve had. Even after rest overnight, the flavor be still pretty strong, and I think next time I make it I\\'ll experiment more with proportion of the seasoning. Still very very nice, and best of all NOT fiddley! I love eggplant, hate direction like, \"carefully paint each 1/2 inch slice with olive oil...\" This recipe be so much easier. Thank you very much for share it with us. A lovely and slightly diffrent badinjan salata. I make the recipe a be except I halve the quantity. I let it sit for 14 hours. The flavour be lovely and not over power nor strong. We eat it for iftaar. Shukran Hajaar and Ramadaan karim. :) I use mince scallion instead of a sweet onion since I didn\\'t have one.  It only sit about 30 minute but everyone LOVES it!!! We have ton of eggplant available in this tropical climate so this recipe be a great choice for use seasonal produce. I love recipe that I can make the night before when I know I will be a reluctant cook on a busy day. Even the kid like this one.',\n",
       " ' Kit, you be not joking!  This recipe be the BEST ever tuna melt.  I didn\\'t have parsely or season salt, but use lemon pepper & a little white salt.  I use extra sour rye bread.  My son doesn\\'t like celery (I always have to try to disquise it!), so he give the recipe a 4 star.  His friend, dad & I all give the recipe a 5 star without any hesitation.  Instead of open-faced, I add a slice of bread on top & broil the whole thing until toasted.  These sandwich be delish!  It\\'ll be the only tuna melt recipe I ever use again.  Thanks! So yummy! This be the way I usually make my tuna salad. I put celery, scallions, and sometimes bell pepper in the food processor and  chop. I love the taste of the vegetables. I do use whole wheat bread for this sandwich, it\\'s all I have on hand. Thanks Kitten! Hi KittenCal;\\r\\nFinally make this recipe yesterday.  It turn out so tasty that I devour the entire lot all by myself and do not give any one a chance to try it.  I want to have this a a snack while watch the Hockey Game, but just couldn\\'t wait. \\r\\nSo, I will be make it again so that I can share.\\r\\nThank you for a well design recipe.\\r\\n\"Uncle Bill\" okay Kit, I listen to you and try this, WOW WOW WOW! this be so so wonderful, my new favorite sandwich, and your so right Kit, I do crave it, thank you. Thanks Kittencal for a great recipe. Had it for dinner last night minus the tomato (they be not too good this time of year). Will be make again, and again, and again. Thanks So I\\'m think to myself, I\\'ve have them before so how could a tuna melt be so \"wonderful\"?  WELL, I make it (just to see what all the hype be about) and I tell you what, it be WAY good than wonderful - it\\'s outstanding!!!  The tomato in between the swiss cheese be so perfect.  I have to make my own season salt (we seem to have every spice know to man in our cabinet except that one - so I look up the ingredient on the internet and voila! we now have home make season salt)but it be quite easy and definitely worth it!  Thanks for change my mind about tuna melts!!! Kit, Sorry it\\'s take me so long to review this. I halve the recipe and like Uncle Bill, I didn\\'t share. I add a little Miracle Whip (I know, I know), but I want a little kick. This be now my own private \"treat yourself special\" recipe. It\\'s easy and I always have the ingredient on hand. It sure beat the ham and cheese sandwich I throw together, when it\\'s just me. Thanks Sweety Very, very delicious!  Highly recommend for tuna melt lovers. Oops Kittencal, I have be mean to review this and I forgot! I love this! We make it with English Muffins and leave out the tomatoes(personal preference) but I can\\'t wait to make them again. Ideal for tuna lover and maybe this will be the tuna melt that will change their minds. Thank you so much for post - we thoroughly enjoy it! Diane :=) This dish be perfect for a quick weekday meal. I use sourdough bread, mozzarella chesse, and omit the celery. The tomato be a great addition to the belt and look really pretty under the melt cheese. Also, I serve these open faced. Thanks for the great recipe! I make this tonight and it be excellent. I use albacore tuna (it\\'s pricey but worth it). The only suggestion I would make be if you like your tomato slice thick, salt them a little first.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor Sams who leave off tomato because they aren\\'t good this time of year, use the little rom italian tomatoes.  They be almost always good and I think they look prettier. This dish be by far too salty and mushy/watery for me.  I like neither the taste nor the consistency.  And the recipe call for too much cheese; it taste waxy and thick.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe best part, I hate to say, be the toast.  I have to throw half of my sandwich away. I have to try this on Wednesday night ... I have \"collected\" enough tuna to make a \"school of tins\".. \\r\\nI follow the recipe off pat and the outcome be to die for.  Thank you, your recipe to me be flawless.. note.. if you follow a recipe a a pattern .. you can\\'t go wrong..\\r\\nThank you again, a well deserve 5 stars!! My DH and I absolutely love this version of a Tuna Melt!  Was very yummy and hearty.  Didn\\'t change a thing and highly recommend this recipe to anyone! I have make this twice now, my family love it.  I use slice muenster cheese in place of the swiss.  Thanks, Kittencal! This be wonderful, the whole family love this. The first batch I make without tomato because my family doesn\\'t really like them. However, after taste mine, I have to make another batch for seconds. I didn\\'t have green onion so I sub red one and I only have sharp cheddar cheese and white french bread. Anyway it be wonderful. Thanks KITTENCAL for another great family please recipe. This be a keeper. I\\'m not too fond of tuna, but this recipe make it enjoyable to eat...maybe even crave! I be out of green onion and swiss so be force to use provolone cheese and a finely grate vidalia onion a substitutes. Still come out delish.  Thanks kittencal! i LOVED this!  Made a few adjustments...used cilantro instead of parsley because that\\'s what I had, use white bread instead because that\\'s also what I have (didn\\'t want to buy more bread when I have good bread at home), add extra lemon juice for some extra zing, and add hard-boiled egg ( i always add hard-boiled egg to my tuna salad, my sister think i\\'m crazy but DH and I love it).  Did go out to buy season salt especially for this, and it be totally worth it!  Thanks for posting.  UPDATE:  have some leave over the other night and take it to work a a wrap (tortilla, cheese, tomato, then tuna)  it be sooooo good a a wrap.  definetely worth trying. Another awesome recipe!  Love it.  I didn\\'t have celery, but I think that would really make the recipe.  I use 2 piece of bread instead of open-faced.  Sooo good!  Thanks again Kittencal! I make this for a guest and she rave on and on about my tuna melt.  Kittencal you be something else in that kitchen This be a great sandwich. I serve mine open face and do add some dill pickle to it (just a personal preference)I would love to try this again with a different cheese, like provolone. Thanks Kittencal for another winner. A Fabulous Tuna Melt! I use a comination of grate Mozarella and Provolone and use sourdough in place of the pumpernickel. Believe it or not I be able to pick this up and eat it without anything slip off! You definitely won\\'t be disappoint in this one! My first time try a tuna melt... and for sure not my last time!!!  This make a great lunch!!  Instead of celery, add some red bell peppers.  Thanks Kit! :) These be delicious! I didn\\'t have pumpernickel or rye- just stale french bread, lol, but they taste fabulous! What can I say?  A great tuna melt.  DH, who previously declare that he do not like rye, have to admit that it be the perfect bread for this tuna melt.  I use lemon pepper, lemon juice, and the season salt a suggested.  Thanks! Really good sandwitch Made this for dinner tonight and the whole fam love it.. ESP. ME!!! I be on WW\\'s and I enter this on the site to see how many point it be and it be ONLY 4 POINTS per serving.. :) I do use white albacore in water, instead of \"tuna\" and I only use 2 tb of shred low fat mozzarella on all of them, along with whole wheat bread..  I leave all the ingredient size the same but on WW\\'s I make it for 5 serve because that be what it end up serve for our family.. FILLING and a way to get full without break the bank on POINTS!!!!! Whooo hoooo- a keeper 4 sure!!! Thanks Kittencal.. :) Made this on English Muffins. Made one with Mozzarella cheese (my favorite cheese) and one with Swiss (not my favorite cheese by far). Believe it or not the Swiss cheese one be my favorite, the Swiss give it a lot of flavor whereas the Mozzarella one be kinda blah. Also leave tomato off (I don\\'t like them). I have tuna leave for 2 more sandwich for tomorrow\\'s lunch, think I\\'ll try American cheese on one and Provolone cheese on the other. Another one to easily rate 5 stars!This be now a staple in our home.  A quick go-to meal that everyone, kid included, LOVE!  However, if you let it sit in the fridge and let the flavor meld it taste even better. Made this on a thick French Roll and use Provolone cheese instead of Swiss.  This be delicious! I be not a big tuna fan but I have be look for way to incorporate it into my diet.  This recipe be fantastic. We love the combination of flavors.  Thanks Kittencal- I know I can always trust your recipes. I love tuna and this be the best tuna melt ever! Definitely crave all of the time. Last time I make it I use the red wine vinegar and I didn\\'t have any green onion so today I\\'m try with lemon and I buy the green onion specifically for this purpose. Oh I can not wait! great recipe for a perfect tuna sandwhich. this will be my go to tuna recipe! We love tuna melts, but I never think it would be possible to make one with such great, strong flavor -- these be fantastic.. the lemon and season salt really perk up the flavor.. this be the only way I\\'ll be season tuna salad again. I read all the reviews, and have to scratch my head at the lone, 1-star review that call it \\'too salty\\', whereby the recipe clearly state \\'salt to taste\\', whatever.. very nice, want something simple and new in a tuna, and you give it to me.  My kid love it,  I be pregnant so I have to use only 1 can of tuna to share between 4 sandwiches, so I didnt eat too much :)  but it be perfect.  Will use this again for sure. And lemon pepper what a kick, would never ha ve think of that to season a tuna, well it will go in my regular bore sandwich too. This be very good. I use 2 slice of bread for each sandwich. I follow the recipe exactly use whole wheat bread. Thanks Kittencal! I fix this for my hubby for lunch today, I don\\'t eat tuna so I leave the review up to him. He really like the open face idea, le bread to fill up on. I do use whole wheat a that be what we always have on hand. He usually have me use Miracle Whip in his tuna melt but I follow your recipe & use Mayo. Also have no swiss on hand so use cheddar but next time I will try the swiss. He really like the tomato. What I do a little different be butter the slice of bread then pile the tuna, tomato & cheese on and grill it butter side down, then when it be toast I put it under the broiler to get the cheese melted. He give you an enthusiastic 5 stars. Thanks Kittencal for another nice addition to my recipe file. I love this! Instead of use a whole tomato slice I chop it up and sprinkle it between the tuna and cheese.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis be fast become my DH most request lunch. My family love this recipe. I\\'ve make it several time and it always a hit. I may sound werid but after my kid birthday party I be leave over with alot of hotdog bun and I subsituted the bread for the buns. My husband say they be extra yummy that day. (lol) Did not feel like cook for one so just halve this recipe and so happy i do this be quick easy and so good!!!!  use fresh home make bread a thats all i have :). will defiantly be make this again. Hey I love this I put it on the tiny rye bread and it be so so good....thanks for your pic and make my dorrito\\'s casserole I be so suprised you make it with you love health food and all...I be wonder what you be serve on the side with it?..It be super pretty, and very colorful my e-mail be Baby_doll_74@hotmail.com thank again hope to hear from you! OK, so I love can tuna a much a the next person, but other than mix it with some mayo and can veg or Tuna Helper, I have no idea what to do with it.  I have never taste a tuna melt before either.  This be UNBELIEVABLY GOOD!  The dress be very similar to one I use for Chicken Waldorf, except mine call for black pepper instead of lemon pepper and salt instead fo season salt.  I look up the Seasoning Salt recipe on Zaar.  The lemon pepper make it sooooo much better!  I will definitely try this for my Waldorf salad dressing.  I\\'m not sure how I feel about hot/warm tomatoes, so I put them on after the bread be toast and they taste great.  Made the melt on homemade French bread and use Havarti instead of Swiss cheese.  Ohhh so good... and very filling.  Thank you! WOW! Fantastic! I grill on the panini maker and put the tomato between the tuna and cheese! Another winner from Kittencal! Thanks so much! This be tasty tuna.  I sort of make this recipe, but then I sort of didn\\'t.  What I make be really good.  I will  make this again with all the ingredient and re-rate it.  What I did:  Tuna, Mayo, Lemon juice, Celery, Seasoning Salt and Lemon Pepper.  I omit the green onion, parsley and tomato (didn\\'t have any) and substitute American cheese and multi-grain bread (because that\\'s what I had.)  It be still really good, much good than tuna, mayo, mustard that I normally throw together.  I think the lemon pepper make all the difference.  Like I said, I will make this again with the ingredient I omit .  Thanks Kittencal!  You always have the best recipes!  <3 Great tuna melt - perfect balance of juicy, crunchy & salty. Really good Tuna Melt! The lemon juice and lemon pepper really add to the flavor of the tuna. Thanks for a great recipe! Excellent and easy recipe for a tuna melt sandwich! My husband dislike tomatoes, so I leave them out. Instead I get some leafy green lettuce and add it after the cheese melt stage. \\nWe also do ours in low-carb tortilla instead of the traditional bread. Best to put the tuna on an oven/microwave safe dish for melt the cheese because the first time we prepare this our tortilla get too stiff and crunchy while in the oven under the broiler. If you do it on a plate first, you can slide the tuna and cheese right onto a fresh, moist tortilla or wrap. Kudos for the use of lemon, too. Not only do it add a little zing to the tuna, to me it reduce the \\'tuna-y\\' smell and if you\\'re break up the pieces/draining by hand, you can rub the empty lemon on your hand to remove the scent. \\nThanks Kittencal for a great basic recipe! I\\'ve make this recipe so many time the paper I print it on be wear out!  We love this sandwich!  Whether you\\'ve cook for 20 year or 20 day this easy recipe will leave you with a smile on your face!  Quick and easy to put together and absolutely delicious!  Thanks Kitt!  This be a recipe in my \"tried and true\" collection that I will be make for many year to come! Nice recipe again again ;o). Added cottage cheese to the tuna in stead of mayonaise and use lime juice. Tasted great, thanks!! I need something quick for supper after DD\\'s tennis tourney and these fit the bill.  I love the crunch from the celery and the use of green onion give it that \"right\" flavor.  I use the rye for DH\\'s and my sandwich but use wheat for DS and DD\\'s and they be perfect.  Thank you for share this quick and yummy recipe. Loved it. I use white onions, a I be out of green. Loved the crunch from the celery, and the double cheese make the sandwich. Thanks! This be an excellent tuna melt.  I love the flavor from the season salt, add lot of black pepper and instead of mince parsley, I use about 3/4 tsp. dry tarragon.  Served on an English muffin with American cheese because that\\'s what I have on hand...but can\\'t imagine it be any better!  Great recipe, love the simplicity, and you\\'re right, Kittencal, it really cure a craving!  Thanks for share this delight that be sure to be a regular in our household. The addition of season salt, lemon juice and Swiss make this a cut above the rest.  We have this for lunch today and it will definitely be in heavy rotation.<br/>Thanks once again, Kittencal! I be great! I use canola mayo and American cheese with jalapeno pepper in it. Yummy! This recipe be a go-to weeknight meal.  I use vegenaise rather than mayonnaise and add a tablespoon of sweet relish and some craisins for sweetness and color.  Beautiful.  Thanks for the recipe. When I ask if I should save this one be tell \"Heck yeah!\"  Loved the not too heavy mayo and the zing of the lemon juice etc... Was tell it be not the usual tuna salad and I too love the flavors.  I try broil with a dill Havarti and it be INCREDIBLE!  Thanks for posting. I make these tonight and everyone in my family really like them. Easy and good - just my style! Absolutely delicious.  I make a few change just to fit my tastes.  I absolutely hate celery so I leave it out but, weird I know, I love radishes.  So I dice some radish and add those instead of celery.  I use one tbsp mayo and one tbsp Greek yogurt to cut on the calorie of regular mayo.  I use Monterey Pepper Jack just for the spicy kick.  It be heavenly! This be a good and easy recipe.  I have to improvise.. I use on can chunk and one can white tuna.. didn\\'t have any tomatoes, and I use Muenster cheese.  I leave it open face on small piece of slice Italian bread and it be crunchy and yummy and good.  Used the lemon juice option & a little sea salt.. also use a dash of celery seeds.  It be yummy! this be really good. I add 1 hard boil egg and some slice green olive to make more. Yummy I use mozzarella cheese and since I didn\\'t have any or rather forget I do have No Tomato I use mozzarella cheese and whole wheat bread and a tiny bite of onion a I have no green onion left- Still so yummy Since I know Kittens recipe be so good I just add some thing in another recipe I know I liked. Thanks so much for an awesome recipe This be the best tuna melt recipe ever! Because of this year\\'s extreme heat, I modify the cook method to a stave top method to toast butter bread in a skillet on both side and then cover the skillet to heat the complete sandwich and to melt the cheese. Thanks Kittencal for this fine recipe! This recipe be a winner in my house! I fell in love with a tuna melt sandwich from an Alabama restaurant when visit family year ago. I&#039;ve have tuna melt locally...still no winners. This one be it!  Thank you Kittencal! Totally awesome recipe.  The Family Circus love this!  Easy to prepare, I have all the ingredient on hand.  I love the flavor so much that I will make this my stand Tuna salad recipe.  Thanks Kittencal...you never fail me! This tuna salad be fantastic. The season salt definitely make it. I use 1/2 tsp season salt, 1/4 tsp lemon pepper and 1 T. fresh squeeze lemon juice. Before I could make my sandwich I be eat this straight out of the bowl and have a hard time stopping. I think it would be great cold on wheat cracker too. I have some cocktail rye and make mini sandwich with it use Havarti dill cheese. These would make great hot appetizer a well. Oh my! Tried this because I be crave tuna... and I think I find my new favourite !  I didn&#039;t have celery so I use celery seed spice, and cut up a red onion enstead of green onion and I still get the crunch. It be fabulous... so glad I stumble upon it!  Thanks! I make a few adjustment and this come out so well! I halve the recipe and use 1 tbsp. of mayo and 1 tbsp of plain greek yogurt to get an extra dose of protein. I also omit the season salt and just use a little salt, pepper, and garlic powder. I also use whole wheat bread and exchange the celery for half of a green bell pepper. This be delicious and will be my new go to lunch! I have never have a tuna melt before...I know strange :)  This be fantastic.  A quick, easy and delicious last minute meal.  I do not have swiss or mozza for the top so use what I had, which be parmesan and romano, and it turn out great. Yum! Thanks for another great recipe! &quot;regular-fat mayonnaise&quot; Love it. Similarly, I refer to No-fat milk, low-fat milk and fat milk. I usually divide the layer to each slice of bread. Tuna mix on one slice, Cheese &amp; tomato on the other. Never skimp on the cheese. But....your picture show the cheese slice UNDER the tuna, not on top?',\n",

       " ' Oh my CaliforniaJan, but this be quite a tasty cocktail.  It&#039;s rather strong so I don&#039;t recommend it to those who prefer light cocktails.  But the cranberry juice add a very nice touch against the Aquavit, and the lime juice provide a great citrus complement.  It&#039;s one of those unique cocktail that could be refresh in summertime or warm in wintertime...a year-round treasure!  Made for ZWT #9 (Scandinavia). Delicious!  I have some all natural cranberry juice, so I just use a splash of that since fresh cranberry be hard to come by in August!  Made a second one (hic) with a bite of absolut vodka too.  Made for ZWT 9 This be surprisingly tasty. I&#039;m not usually an aquavit fan but my DH like it so we keep a bottle in the freezer. The herb and spice in the aquavit  be  complement by the cranberry and lime without be hidden. I do reduce the liquor by 2 TBLS so I could continue to function, and after taste add a splash of 100% cranberry juice to go with the muddle berry which bump it from 4 to 5 stars. Now when DH be quaff straight aquavit I&#039;ll have an option to enjoy with him. Made for ZWT 9 Scandinavia by one of Mike and the Appliance Killers.',\n",

I have no cauliflower and use some chop kale instead, and instead of PB I use macadamia nut butter (just what I have around.)  The combo of ginger with the slight hint of nut butter be awesome.  On the second day I add some mung bean sprout and a little tamari.  I can see this be very versatile a far a add ins.

They each get second and be disappoint when they couldn't get thirds. As they be drink it they be also brainstorm about how it would work with other kind of jello (lime, strawberry, etc.). The kid woiuld give this 6 star if they could! They even want some in their lunch bag for the next day! I think we be go to try this with different flavor of jello and see what we can come up with!

I use olive oil instead of canola. I also use bottle lime juice and pour a little extra in the pan after the fish be cook to drizzle over it.  The pepper give it just the right kick and the cumin go wonderfully with the lime.  My husband (whose family be from Maui) raved.   this Mahimahi have wonderful flavour, love the lime and cumin together with just enough heat from the pepper.  I use olive oil a I have no canola. We will be have this again, it be quite delicious, thank for sharing. Delicious recipe!am new in Hawaii and i want to cook this delicious fish.your recipe really help me.also i add a tea spoon of corn starch and before serve i put brown onions.it be absolutely superb.Thanks a lot!!! I use lemon and olive oil (no limes; no canola) and it be fast, simple and taste great.   Actually, my 3 year old love it!  I use just a spray of olive oil and cut it in half, but otherwise leave it a is.  Very nice flavor.  Nice and easy and healthy! I'm normally not a fish fan,but this be amazing! I know I'll be make this alot.\\r\\nI follow the recipe to the letter and it be absolutely perfect.I serve it with white rice and there wasn't a drop of fish leave at the end of dinner. Thanks! This recipe be absolutely delicious, & work w/ WW core.  Wonderful!  Thank you, Judy! This be excellent, I serve it with white rice and zucchinni.  I also substitute the lime with 2 True Lime packet and a 1/2 C. water. Thank You! What a tasty yet easy recipe!  It be a little too lime-y for us, but after add some red pepper flakes, it be great.  This will be make frequently, especially since it go together so quickly.  I serve it with brown rice and edamame.  Thanks Judy! I be have a hard time even describe how delicious it was. I use this to make fish tacos, and they be the best I have ever made. The only change I make be use a bite le oil- I make it for 1 person (using about 4 ounce of fish) and I use 1 tsp oil. We make this for dinner last night and think it be really good.  Very simple to prepare, yet very flavorful.  I like that it use ingredient that I typically have on hand.  I halve the ingredient a I have 1 lb of fish, which work out great.  I would definitely make this again.  Thanks! Everyone in my family love this!  DS's (12 and 15) both clean their plates.  I have 1.25 pound fish, so halve the recipe.  Alas, I do not have fresh lime so use lime juice, pour in what I estimate to be the juice of 1 lime.  Evidently I over-estimated because my marinade be more liquid than a paste.  So I combine the mahi piece and marinade in a plastic bag and let sit in my fridge for almost an hour before cooking.  I cook the fish in a pan w/ about 2 teaspoon olive oil for the 8 minutes, but decide the piece weren't cook enough and so turn the heat up to medium high for another 2 or 3 minutes.  The piece become slightly brown which make them more visually appealing!  I serve with brown basmati rice and asparagus.  I will definately be make this again - next time mahi mahi be on sale! Wow-- even my 6 and 3 year old girl gobble this up. I make it accord to the direction and serve it over rice with mild fresh salsa and a corn, black bean, avocado salad with cilantro. Thanks Judy from Hawaii for this nice spring/summer meal! Next time, I'll increase the amount of lime juice just a little. Otherwise, this be delicious, fast, and easy. I'll definitely make it again. Delicious! I accompany the fish with fresh salsa, and serve wild rice, black beans, and steam broccoli on the side. I substitute the Mahi Mahi for Tilapia and it be really good!  It be so simple to make!  I only use 1 and a half lime because it really didn't turn into a paste; more like a marinade.  Either way it be great though.  We pair it with Barb Gertz's Baja Black Beans, Corn and Rice (http://www.recipezaar.com/Baja-Black-Beans-Corn-and-Rice-55768) for a really flavorful and healthy meal.  I will definitely be come back to this recipe. Really delicious! I use lemon juice instead of lime because it's what I have on hand. Used one lemon. I also use olive oil instead of canola. Will definitely make this again! This be OUTSTANDING!!  So easy too... Thank you, my family love it! Mahalo :) Personally, I love cumin, but never use it on fish. I be worry that my wife might not like it because she's le of a cumin fan that I.  But the fish turn out great.  Used olive oil.  Grilled some green and yellow squash and portobello mushtooms a our side.  One of the best fish dish I've made. I really like the taste of cumin in this. It add a really interest flavor to the fish. I add a bite of South African Smoke Flavored Spice from TJ's (my favorite!), and make this in the oven. Served with brown rice and zucchini. Will definitely make again! This be DELICIOUS! I will make it again and again. We eat pretty Paleo, so I use Olive Oil. My husband love it, too! Thanks for make me look good in the kitchen lol Absolutely amaze\",\n",

I didn't like the flavor of these.  They be very bland and I have to put honey on them in order to eat them. I've make these twice.  They be awesome in a pinch.  I serve them a an accompaniment to dinner and we eat them with just a bite of butter on them.  The mild flavor go well with anything.  We thoroughly enjoy these.  They're on my list of quick to make for dinner.  Thank you. Very easy. We really like these. I felt they need a little more salt, but I have to add about 5 c. of flour to get a decent consistency. I melt 3 T. of butter and add 1 T. of honey. I brush this on them when I pull them out of the oven. Yummy!\",\n",
       " \" Oh wow, this be fantastic!  I cut the recipe in half and could have eat the whole two loaf by myself.  Outstanding flavor! The recipe can be cut in half, and still have enough for two loaf of french bread, but the taste be out of this world.  Instead of fresh tomatos, I use a can of Rotel's, and that add a bite of zing to the mixture.  It's on the regular rotation!\",\n",
       " ' This be good -- though I use dice chicken instead of shredded, just because that be what I had.  Served on a tortilla.  Quite tasty and very simple.',\n",
       " ' Surprisingly delicious. I do use Trader Joe&#039;s sunflower seed butter. It taste really good a a SSB&amp;J sandwich, good than it do plain (which seem quite savory, but it do work well with the jam). Thanks!',\n",
       " ' This be sooooo good! My boyfriend grow up eat Hungarian food and I be happy to report he say it even good than his mother\\'s recipe! This be one of those recipe where I would give more than 5 star if I could. It be delicious -- fabulous flavour! -- and the recipe work just a it say it will. I don\\'t have a single quibble: the instruction be straightforward and very simple and this be quite easy to prepare. I follow it exactly a written, with 2 small additions. After cook the onion (step 4), I add 1/3 cup merlot to deglaze the pan, before I add the meat back in. Then, a well a the 2 tbsp Hungarian paprika, I add a good sprinkle of smoke paprika too (I\\'ve be add it to recipe a lot lately). I serve this over Bev\\'s Mashed Potato Pancakes (recipe #31061), which I think work well. My entire family enjoy dinner; thank so, so much for post this recipe: it\\'s a real keeper. This be the best Hungarian Goulash recipe I\\'ve ever tasted! Even my picky kid love it! I didn\\'t have a lot of time, so I substitute venison steak for the stew beef, and cut the simmer time to about 30 minutes. It be delicious. Thanks. Please add me to the fans! I have some particularly tough meat I want to use up, so I simmer it much longer, in more water (plus broth). Otherwise I follow the recipe. This be delicious. We will have it over rice (though I\\'m sure noodle would be delicious, too.) Thank you very much for share this recipe. I will use it often (of course, even when I don\\'t have tough meat.) My family enjoy this very much! I add half a cup of red wine and it be wonderful. We have it with mash potatoes. Thanks! That be very good! I use spanish paprika, (1 tsp sweet and 1 tsp hot), and it go well. I´ll repeat it with hungarian paprika if I can find it to notice the difference. I serve it with rice a a side dish. this be delicious!  i serve it over egg noodles, but i also add large amount of merlot to it while cooking.  i also add large amount of merlot to my stomach, but it be a sunday afternoon, so why not? ;-)  it be almost stroganoffy...with the sour cream.  but definitely one of the most delicious thing i\\'ve ever cooked. This be delicious! I be a huge hungarian paprika fan and this hit the spot. I have a tough cut of meat, so I let it cook quite a while with no problem. I also add a touch of dry dill. I just couldn\\'t help myself. :) Thank you for a great dinner! So very, very tasty - good than five stars. The meat be so tender and melt in the mouth.  Very good. I didn\\'t have any sour cream so I add a splash of wine instead. Also add some mushroom the last 10 minutes. Will definately be make this again. Very tasty!  Next time, though, I won\\'t cook the onion a much - they disappear into the sauce!  I also use cornstarch to thicken and add a little garlic powder.  Will definitely be make this again (soon)! I can\\'t believe that something so easy to make can taste so goooood :))))  be a VERY tasty meal. thank so much for sharing.  Best I\\'ve ever tried.  I follow it exactly. Just wonderful! Perfectly spice with a rich creamy sauce. I follow suggestion from previous reviewer - add a glug of red wine to deglaze the pan & didn\\'t cook the onion all the way to carmelization.  I serve it over egg noddle and enjoy every bite.  Thanks for posting. Delicious! I be crave one that be make for me and I only have to make 2 alteration to make it a I\\'d remember it tasting. Awesome! I slice a NY strip into long thin strips, added, slice Bell Pepper, and serve it over Egg Noodles. Fantastic..Thanx again. :) Awsome. So easy yet sooooo good. I also have trouble find the hungarian paprika so have to use the Spanish one instead. This recipe be a must have. Great! This dish be fantastic. One of the best I\\'ve try from RZ. I thought, use three pound of stew beef, that I would have a lot of leftovers, but there be barely enough for my husband to take to work for lunch the follow day! My kid gobble it up and say \"Make this again, Mom!\"\\n\\nI put everything together accord to direction and then transfer it to the slow cooker and let it simmer on low for about 6 hours. I stir in the sour cream just before serve (I didn\\'t need to thicken it with the flour/water). Super easy and delicious. What more could you ask for? Thanks for share this recipe! This be great and very easy to make! A winner! This be a good, very easy basic recipe. I have all of the ingredient to make this and it turn out fairly well. I use 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. I\\'ll add some garlic and caraway seed next time. Thanks for posting. it\\'s ok but not my favorite. thank for the recipe anyway! Not bad.  A little too thin for our taste, so I thicken even further. Very good! My old and I love it! My 5 yr old didn\\'t care for it.\\nThank you! This be a good recipe.  I do add a bite more sour cream but otherwise follow the directions.  I serve this with butter noodle and cauliflower.  Thank you for share with us. I chop the onion very thinly use a mandolin. They pretty much disappear once cook - which I like since I\\'m not a huge fan of onions. I add some slice up sweet bell pepper towards the end, and serve over egg noodles. DH wasn\\'t a huge fan. It\\'s decent comfort food for a cold night, but I\\'m not quite sure it be worth all of the prep work. Thanks for share the recipe. This recipe be SO good! I admit the Hungarian paprika we currently have make me nervous (it say it\\'s \"sweet\", but it\\'s kinda hot to my wimpy senses!) so I use 1 tb Hungarian and 1 tb California sweet paprika. I also follow the suggestion of a couple reviewer and deglaze with ~ 1/2 c merlot after caramelize the onions. *I* think it be perfect; my husband think it be a tad sweet (though he gobble it up!) and want me to try make it next time with all Hungarian paprika. I\\'ll definitely be make this again, so I\\'m sure that will happen sooner or later! Thanks so much for share this! A definite keeper. Followed the recipe exactly and it be fabulous. My wife doesn\\'t much like anything with noodle and her verdict was, \"I love it, and you know if I like anything with noodle it be really good.\" This be a good dish, but make sure that you cook the beef long enough so the meat be tender!   I do add mushroom and use about 1/4 cup of wine to de-glaze my pot.  I find there be a lot of liquid so I have to add about 1/2 cup of flour mixture to thicken it up.  Next time, I might try this in my crock pot! I have to agree with the review on this one. Excellent!! I use only about 2 lb of beef in the recipe, and keep all the other ingredient the same. I also deglaze the onion (and about 6 garlic cloves) with red wine, and then simmer for a full two hours. I certainly didn&#039;t need to add any thicken agent at the end, and even add a bite of leave over beef broth to lean it out abit. I also use a 50/50 blend of Hungarian paprika and smoke paprika. This one will be a keeper for sure! Thanks! It&#039;s not even do and I can&#039;t stop eat it out of the pot. SO good! I like to add some tomato and several smash garlic clove when stew the meat, and to thicken I use a roux I make &amp; store in the fridge.',\n",
       " ' Everyone in the family take one taste of this angel food cake and say yuck!  Definitely will not be make this again. My MIL make this and it be fantastic.  Very light and refreshing.  We have ours with cool whip.  Very simple, she stir hers all together in the 9x13 pan and bakes-no bowl to clean up! this be really good  serve with cool whip and cherry',\n",
       " \" I make these up use my own bread crumbs, add the Italian Seasoning and garlic, but otherwise make a per recipe.  These be easy and fun to make up, and delicious too.  I freeze up the the 10 not eat then wrap individually and put into labled gallon freezer bag for late use.  Now that it be just me, these will become regular once a month cook for my meals.  Thank you for a great recipe. These be delicious!  I love the sauce.  It be quite sweet which I really liked. And these cook up really fast and take no time at all really to prep.  I do definitely say to follow the recipe poster advice use the less fat content grind beef a I use 80/20 and it be really greasy!  I have to take the loaf out of the muffin tin and make a separate batch of the sauce.  I actually think the extra sauce be a good idea though a we all spoon ton of it over the loaves.  I do add a little garlic powder to the meat mixture which I think give it a little extra oomph.  Thank you for post this wonderful recipe.  I will be make this time and time again! Wonderful! Love these serve size mini-loaves!  Sure save have to use a knife to cut a slice of leftover meatloaf, & it's so nice to have more of the crispy brown this way, too. :-) Forgot to spray the tin & the loaf still scoop out perfectly. I use grind sirloin. Thanks, Redneck Epicurean, for this little jewel of a recipe that I will be make over and over! -Becky Great recipe when have guest over for dinner.  They love it. Thanks. very good recipe...thank you. I make these and put them uncooked in my freezer.  I make and freeze the sauce seperately.  They work wonderfully, everyone in my family love them!! Very good, thank you! Next time I will make a bite of extra sauce. Thanks for posting! Loved it!! These mini meatloaf come out delicious! Had some baby spinach to go with them. Very yummy!\",\n",
       " ' Yep!  It\\'s true...this be a great chop liver!  I pan fry the liver and then cook the onion in the same pan to get all the flavor.  Don\\'t make any changes...this be great a written!  Thanks so much Mirj! This be AMAZING!! Wish we have more occasion to make it. I follow the recipe a write and I can\\'t believe how wonderfully it come out. <br/>Thanks so much for posting!! This be delicious...   thank Mirj. I can understand why your chop liver be so famous. I would give this recipe 6 star if I could. My husband be eat it out of the dish with a spoon. Thank you for share this recipe. I have to get back to the kitchen before he eat it all ! I would give this 10 star if I could.  I love it :)  Thanks for another great recipe.  I make Challah from scratch and the 2 go together perfectly! Wonderful, traditional recipe. I reduce the egg to 2, just our personal preference. Served on a lettuce leaf, garnish with cherry tomatos, and alongside some challah for shmearing... My guest just love it. Thanks Mirj Use schmaltz..it\\'s not that hard to make and make all the difference in the world. Prepared this a an appetizer at my daughter birthday dinner..followed recipe to a T. Served with an assortment of crackers..enjoyed a few spoonful straight out of the processor a well! Recipe be darn good--I just don\\'t agree with the title. Incredibly outstanding! Everyone ask for the recipe. I think this one of the least fatten version of chop liver I\\'ve ever made. I use only 2T. of oil for 8 onions. I broil 2 lbs.of liver and add 4 hard boil eggs. It be perfect. Thanks Mirj for share so may of your recipes. Awesome!  My family\\'s only complaint be that I didn\\'t make a double batch.  I follow the recipe a be and wouldn\\'t change a thing.  Thanks!   My ex mother-in-law, always make the best chicken livers. Till I taste this. Fantastic. This dish have become a staple with me. Yum. Exactly what I be expect it to be. I do not know it be so easy to make and really not that bad for you (I use le oil for the onion than the recipe call for). Mirj, another winner!\\nMy recipe be identical, but I fry the liver on top of the onion once they be soft. , so all the flavor mesh; then I throw it in the processor with the eggs. I\\'ve be use much le oil these day and make recipe work, and this be no exception. I use 1tbsp of oil,and fry the onion gently, and when I add the livers, I didn\\'t need any more oil since the liver add juice to the pan. The taste be the same a it always was, and the NI change dramatically. I hope more people try this recipe! Lovely! what a great recipe! another one that you should eat in the ER or a cardiologist office, lol. this be jewish soul food at it best. i do use le oil for the onion and broil the livers. excellent!!! Mirj, Your recipe be very similar to mine. The only difference be that I don\\'t measure, but the ingredient be the same. For many year in make this recipe, I use to mash everything by hand with a fork and a potato masher, and it wasn\\'t easy! But now I use the food processor. I\\'ve be make it for our seder a an appetizer, but occasionally, make it during the year a well, and serve it a hors d\\'oevres on Triscuits. Everyone that like chop liver rave about it. It be a wonderful recipe and I be glad you post it for others to use. And truly, it isn\\'t that bad for you! There be other recipe that be a lot worse, health-wise! Hmm, I think I have review this, but I guess not. I make it for the holidays, and my husband have be beg me to make it again. My jewish BIL give it his thumb up. Really, it\\'s pretty easy to make, and delicious to eat. Loved it!  I grow up in a Jewish neighborhood and this taste like home.  Beware - it make way more than 8 servings!  I\\'m freeze my leftovers, we\\'ll enjoy again in the future. This be the best chop liver I have ever had! I could go on & on but you\\'ve probably hear it all before. Thank you for such a wondeful recipe. Fabulous !  My entire extend family say it be the best chop liver I\\'ve ever made.  Broiling the liver be great, I hadn\\'t do that before.  It\\'s so much easy than pan frying.  I use schmaltz to fry the onions, which give a great flavor !  Thanx Mirj. Unbelievable!  I make it for Passover and people love it.  Followed the recipe exactly.  Great! This be actually healthy for you (well accord to my diet-Paleolithic), bar the salt - but I\\'ll make it without salt and can eat it all I want (and have no problem spoon it out and eat it just like that!).  Thanks for the great recipe! Just llike my Bubbe\\'s chop liver! YUM! I use some leftover calves\\' liver from a previous night, and go out to the store to get chicken fat (schmaltz) to fry the onion in instead of oil.  This be the best chop liver I\\'ve ever had! I serve it on top of Carr\\'s water cracker and sprinkle a touch of flake salt and crack pepper before serving. Thanks for a fantastic recipe! Yeah!  First time I make chop liver! I broil the liver too.  I use a mini chopper so I need to split the liver, etc. into 2 batch and then I combine them in a bowl.  Really need to learn to use my big Cuisinart food processor.  I use chicken fat instead of oil because I have it in the freezer so this really be the heart attack special. Used 1 tsp. kosher salt.  This be delicious and I be so proud of myself.  Thanks for a great recipe Mirj! PS - my Dad say \"this be truly excellent!\" I be go to make this for all the holidays!!! Everyone raved! Wow! I couldn\\'t believe that such an easy recipe could turn out so fantastic. I dice up 3 very large onions, think it be too much, but the result be extraordinary.\\r\\nI would\\'ve like to get a courser mix,as I be in a hurry to taste this, but I have no complaint and many praise for this recipe. I can\\'t wait to try it publicly for my next party ( which mean I didn\\'t want to share the initial batch because it be so addicting). Thank you very much. Perfect recipe. I cut the onion in half then into thin-ish half ring and cook them in shmaltz. Everything else I do a stated. Thanks for posting. This make our Shabbat extra special :) Wow.. I\\'ve never make \"pate\" or chop chicken livers.. I completely concur with the other reviews.  VERY yummy, and EASY!  The caramelize onion add a lot of flavor and the boil egg lighten it up a bit.  I add a tb of fat from fry some wing early in the even (making this for a party tonite) because it seem a little stiff.  I think my kid will even eat this.  Thanks for a great recipe! Have people who shy away from chop liver spend too much time with that gummy gray stuff which is, admittedly, very unappetizing?  This chop liver be different by light years!  It have dimension, texture, and identifiable flavors, and look a good a it tastes.  Our only change to this great recipe be use one onion per pound of chicken liver (we usually make two pounds) and do everything with render chicken fat.  We also add about 1/4 cup of Madiera to get the consistency just right.  Don\\'t process it too much - you want to see the brown bit of onion and taste the occasional chunk of liver.  What a delicious treat!  Thanks, Mirj .... I need to make some again very soon! I make this for dinner this evening. The only change I make be to add some garlic and a shallot. I caremelized the onion first and then add the liver into the fry pan (I hate the broiler). If there be any leave at all I\\'ll be very, very surprised. This be absolutely awesome, thank for the new favorite! My boyfried, who like liver, LOVED this!  I\\'ve never be a fan of liver and even I think that it be good, though I didn\\'t share my boyfriend love for it.  I make a direct and add a splash of cream at the end because it be a little dry than I expected. He be very impress and eat half of the bowl in one sitting.  Thanks for share a great recipe! I have never have chop liver before but really want to try.  I make this for dinner tonight and get some strange look from my kids.  (It didn\\'t look like anything they have ever eat before...lol) BUT.....once they try it they really like it.  It be really rich though and I couldn\\'t eat too much of it.  I doctor up some saltine cracker with herb and garlic and we be in heaven.  Thank you so much for share some entirely new to us. It be delicious!!! This be absolutely wonderful and unlike the store buy version there be no add sugar, all that sweetness come from the onions. We serve this on some nice home make crusty challah and it be delicious. Of course it make enough to serve an army so although I\\'d love to make it more often I and my DH can\\'t eat it all by ourselves but definitely when you have a houseful, it\\'s great to serve this a a pate with some cracker or bread. This be fantastic!  Thank you Mirj! This dish be phenomenal!!! I never have chicken liver before meet my jewish husband, and it be one of those food I can\\'t have just once a year. I love the onion in this recipe, and process it to a pate. Served it in a bread bowl for New Years, and will  be bring it to Easter dinner with my family. This time I will try the broiler method of cook the livers. I canot wait!!! All the ingredient for the best chop liver however the ultimate chop liver be my mothers, mine a close 2nd. 1st After fry and don\\'t forget spice your onion until browned, remove them and then fry your liver in the same oil add more if require until extremely well do ensure you spice well (easy on the salt) Kosher Liver can already be salty. Although I use fresh garlic for everything, Only granulate garlic for chop liver. The other trick be to u a meat grinder rather than a processor and alternate your addition absolutely include all of the pan oil and drippings. The texture absolutely affect the taste!! Never add sugar, ewww!!!! Let it cool for a few hour for the flavour to come together and enjoy. We make about 12lbs at the holidays!!! Nice to see some bullabustas out there!!!! This be the best chop liver I\\'ve ever eaten.  It be a winner from the first time.  The only thing I do differently be that I saute the liver in bacon fat and then drain them.  Outstanding. Yeah, this be the one.  I didn\\'t even have to make it to know.  By the way, read Weston Price; it\\'s extremely healthful.  Tomorrow I will attempt to get some chicken skin from the market before they throw them away.  \"A\" plus plus plus plus. If you use a good fat to fry it in (ghee, coconut oil or bacon fat) this be a fantastic recipe! Lovely, Mirj, and not at all a &quot;heart attack on a plate&quot;!! I make the (so easy) recipe a it stands, except make it a little un-kosher by fry the onion in a mixture of olive oil and butter. I also add a glug of medium sherry and a little balsamic vinegar to the liver (fried in olive oil). It&#039;s a lovely recipe, and so easy, but I think maybe I should have add a few extra flavour such a nutmeg and garlic. I use sea salt flake and coarse black pepper. And I&#039;m go to warm it up so we can have it a the main meat dish tonight, with ciabatta toast and fresh veggies, and salad. Thanks!!! This recipe sound just the way I make it except I saute the liver with the onions. Therefore, I&#039;m give it five plus stars, because I make it the way my mother does, and it&#039;s delicious. Can I freeze this spread?  Please advise me a I want to make it tomorrow for a party.\\nThanks!  How long do chicken fat keep.  I make it a few week ago, maybe longer, and have it in my fridge.  Can I still use this? I&#039;ve make this recipe 2x now and I&#039;m in love with it. I&#039;m not keen on the whole offal thing but I&#039;m anemic and I agree to  try chicken liver. I&#039;m glad that I find this recipe because I can&#039;t stop shovel it in my mouth. I don&#039;t know if it&#039;s heart healthy but it sure be fill with iron and protein. Thanks Mirj! Best chicken liver I\\'ve ever have ! It only last a couple hour for husband and I. I make another batch the next day. This be great stuff! Thanks Mirj for this recipe. I find this recipe on a different site 9 year ago and have be make it ever since. I’d never have chop liver before meet my Jewish husband and try his mom’s; it wasn’t great but show me that chicken liver be something I could enjoy, so I look for a recipe I could make myself. Now, I’m the designate chicken-liver-maker for every holiday and special occasion thank to this recipe! The only thing I do differently be cook the liver in the same pan after I’ve brown the onions, although I’ll try broil them soon. Sometimes I’ll add a touch of cream sherry if the liver be too bitter, but usually the onion add the perfect amount of sweetness. I absolutely adore this simple yet delicious recipe.',\n",
       " \" This be a delightfully different one dish meal.  Additional asparagus and carrot be add and I find that it wasn't necessary to precook them.  They be do in the amount of time that it take the salmon to cook.  Made for *ZWT 2009* WOW, this be excellent. I love this and will be make again. Made a tasty and healthy lunch. Made a direct only use le salt (my personal preference). ZWT5 This be just great.  I be look for a way to shake up how I generally prepare salmon, and this be a perfect solution.  I love how tender and delicious the veggie come out.  I serve it over a bed of spinach, which wilt nicely under the heat of the salmon and sauce and make a lovely presentation and great flavor.  I like my veggie crisp, so I omit the pre-cooking step, and find them to be perfect that way.  I omit the salt (personal preference).  Thank you for share this! My husband and I love this recipe. I use regular coconut milk (instead of the light version), and it be delicious. I also have to sub zucchini for asparagus, but everything be super tender and the flavor compliment each other nicely. Yum! Nothing good for a weekday meal than a 30 minute or le meal in one pot! (Okay, so we do a little steam of the veggie first in the microwave, but no biggie, still easy clean up). :)<br/>I keep to the recipe a stated, but only have green part of the onion on hand so I double the amount for flavor.\",\n",
       " \" This recipe have the kick we be look for!!It be esy to follow.thanks for posting!! We just love this one.  Scrumpious!!!!!  You weren't kid abbout the smoke detector. :)  Thanks for sharing.  :) it be great I never make black anything before,it be all that I expected, but it be extreamly smokey make sure your house be well open up before this one  This make for delicious Blackened Chicken, a wonderful 'treat meal'. We so enjoy the the season that I have be use it to season my grill and bake chicken breasts. Plan on make this out on the grill this summer! This be very good.  I do put the blacken season on both sides.  I think this may have be a little much.  Very tasty though. I be not a cook, but want something to go with some red bean & rice (Zattirans out of box - I know, I know), and think I would look for a Blackened Chicken Recipe.  This be delicious and so easy even for me.  I thank you very much for post this recipe. This be a very good season mix. I think it might be a bite strong to rub directly on the chicken so I throw it in the blender with some bread crumb and use the mix a a fry chicken dredge. It be fantastic, but a bite salty. I will make it again, but next time I'll cut the salt to 1tbls. Great season mix. Ok it be a bite to spicy for me but I love it and so do my fiance. Next time I'll use le black pepper.\\n\\nThanks! Loved the seasoning! The spice factor be perfect - a little too much salt ... but I measure by eye, so probably my fault. Delicious .... and yes, my smoke alarm go off. My boyfriend find it hilarious.... Served on an onion roll with lettuce, tomato, red onion and mayo. Perfect! Yum, yum, yum!  After read other reviews, I cut the salt back by half, and it taste great. I do add about 1/4 c hot sauce to the butter, but didn't drizzle the additional butter on both side of the chicken a it be cooking.  I be try to mimic the sandwich at one of our favorite bar and grill here, so I add 2 tsp butter to the pan after remove the chicken, toss in some thinly slice green pepper and onion and saute it, scrap up some of the crust black goody from the pan a I did.  I toast Kaiser rolls, place the chicken on, top with provel cheese, stick it under the broiler until the cheese be melt and then top with a good help of the onion and pepper with lettuce, tomato, pickle on the side.  Only change I will make next time be to cut back on the cumin just slightly, and use smoke paprika.  But this be just fantastic.  Thanks so much for posting! this be great I buy the blacken season already mix and do hit it with a little liquid smoke, so it would taste like it come off the grill. My kid tell me it be the best chicken ever.  My husband eat until he get sick. Will make again thank for sharing. Just what I be look for.  I want to make blacken chicken to go on top of my alfredo and this work perfectly.  I reduce the salt to 1 Tbs and cook the chicken on the grill to keep the smoke out of the house.  Thanks for a great recipe that I can use again and again - I put the leftover into a spice bottle for next time.  Should last u a while!\",\n",

       " ' OUTSTANDING burger Potsie!!! I add a splash of Grey Goose to the season burger a DH2B look on in horror, but it be really good!! I use the George Forman Grill for the first stage in cooking. I use DotM\\'s <a href=\"/89932\">Bread Maker Hamburger Buns</a> and add dry jalapeno flake with my onion flake to the top and toss some cheddar into the bread machine - DELICIOUS! I also use Kitz\\'s <a href=\"/71055\">Really Easy and Good Steak Sauce</a>. This burger come together so nicely! The flavor all mingle and be a vibrant a Bergy! This be a totally delicious burger and I will be make this again. You Rock!! Cheers!  OK, when I be make this I really think to myself, well, I be sure this will be good, but a burger be a burger, right? WRONG!! This be really one terrific burger!!\\nI pretty much follow the recipe, just make a couple of slight adjustment that I don\\'t think really change the outcome of this burger. I add an egg and a few bread crunmbs to my raw hamburger meat before shape into patties, just because I be a chicken and be afraid it would fall apart on me while grilling. Of course I use the grill option!\\nNow, a per Queen Bergy\\'s add on, I add some chop up mushroom to the onion and pepper mix and fry them all up. I use HP sauce and begin heating. Then I have a glass of wine ..... ummmm .... and promptly forget about the stuff on the stovetop! The HP and veggie mix cook on my range for I don\\'t know how long! When I finally realize what I have do and run inside to *save* it, most of the liquid have pretty much cook off and the end result be a delicious relish-like spread that taste just like Branston Pickle! I be so pleased! LOL!\\nAnyway,the flavour of the jalapenos, and melt cheese under the broiler, couple with the sauce be soooo good, my DH say 10 star for this one.\\nLOVED IT!!!! Thanks for a terrific Ode to Bergy! This be a terrific tribute to zaar\\'s burger queen Bergy! The flavor here be terrific and I make no change other than add slice mushroom to the onion & peppers.  I also use the Montreal Steak season and worchestershire in the grind beef.  Thank you Potsie for a wonderful meal! Oh man these be the BEST burgers!  I agree with Leslie, a burger be a burger, but oh no it be not.  I can\\'t even think of the word to describe how awesome this burger is.  I don\\'t think I will ever make \"regular\" burger\\'s again.  Just Bergy\\'s!  Thanks Pot Scrubber for post this great recipe! I be honor that this fabulous burger be dedicate to me -  I make it tonight and say this be a combo of  so many flavor I love!  One thing not in the recipe be mushroom - I must have mushrooms! I use a local Jalapeno- Habenaro Gouda cheese - Lots of \"hot\" in this cheese and find a great Onion Cheese bun to serve it on. For the steak sauce I use Bulls Eye Steak sauce. I like the idea of put the cheese on the pepper etc but I do it on the skillet and put a lid over it til it melted.  The burger be still sit on one side of the pan. Thanks Potsie for honor me in this way!  I love it! Reviewed for PAC Fall 2007\\r\\nZUT ALORS!!!\\r\\nTHIS be THE BEST Burger I\\'ve had...fantastic...thanks for the great supper tonight,Baby Potsie. I think the combination be pretty good. I make the pepper, onion and steak sauce into a relish instead and add some ketchup for some sweetness. I also want it separate since others didn\\'t like this combination. Good thing I do because my husband hat it, he actually spit it out! Oh well, can\\'t win them all. I even use the relish to dip some french fry in. It be pretty good. I roast the pepper first and use a red one. I didn\\'t use the pepper or mustard, though. I use pork burger instead and season them with steak seasoning, garlic salt and mince onion. I also top the burger with american cheese in addition to the pepper jack. The Queen have spoken. Total yumminess on a charcoal grill- the onion roll make this recipe! I don\\'t normally use steak sauce so I make a homemade Heinz 57 type for my burger. Awesome. I will make my burger like this again. Great combination of flavor and heat to however you want it.',\n",

And if desired, you could sneak meat in on the bean layers, but it be really not needed. Great recipe! Believe it or not I have most of these ingredient in the fridge/cupboard, so I decide to give it a whirl.\\r\\nOnly adjustment be green chile instead of jalepenos, I add a little shred chicken to vegetable mixture and I only end up with enough fill for 5 layers.\\r\\nThe goat cheese flavor be prominent and I felt the white rice I use be bland and didn't add anything to the dish.\\r\\nThe tortilla end up doughy.  The taste be pretty darn good, but I'm not crazy about the doughy taste/texture of the flour tortillas.  Maybe corn tortilla  ?? , or maybe lightly brown the  flour tortilla in a frypan prior to layer next time.    Thanks for sharing.\\r\\nI insert a pic of mine. Delicious!! Made it for my tennis team.

Next time I be go to try it with green enchilada sauce and I will use corn tortilla agian. everyone love it! we add in some taco meat with the bean though :) I use brown rice, mexi corn instead of plain corn, cut out the goat cheese, forget the cream cheese, add onion, green onion, pepper jack cheese. \\r\\n\\r\\nI didn't have a dutch over or anything to cover the casserole dish, but it still turn out well. \\r\\n\\r\\nI think next time I'll add grind beef w/ taco season for some extra protein, since I have lapband and need more protein. \\r\\n\\r\\nI will make this dish again. This be a tough one to rate. I think it be ok but my DH take about 3 bite and put the rest back. He couldn't stand the goat cheese. If I make it again I'll substitute an 8 oz. pkg. of cream cheese for the cream cheese/goat cheese mixture. I'll also probably cut the recipe in half a this make a LOT for just the two of us.

This be so easy to make because I have all the ingredient on hand and I could just use anything. I use tuna fish, peas, cream of mushroom soup (I get the inspiration from the other reviewer), potatoes, and breadcrumb for the topping. I also put olive in there, and season it with garlic powder, paprika, and salt. I can throw together a pretty good casserole, but it be really nice to have the measurement all write out and some new suggestion for ingredient (almonds). This be what I use for this one: 1 large cook chicken breast (diced), 1 can whole mushroom (cut in half), 2 cup (when dry) cook macaroni, 1 1/2 cup sour cream, slice almond and some cheddar cheese mix in with it all. I top it with some parmesan and toast bread crumbs. I use garlic powder, pepper and season salt for seasoning, but I would recommend use a lot more. That\\'s it!

He be the King of Comfort Food, every single recipe of his that I\\'ve try have definitely fall deeply into the Comfort Zone, and this one be no exception!  This recipe be so simple, but so amazingly delicious, and you can very easily polish off the whole thing on your own (something I almost did).  I use raddiatore, a jar of red pepper and a package of garlic and dill cream cheese.  Richard, I blame you for make me fall off my diet! I be look for something fast and easy--a dish that didnt require use the oven in hot and humid weather & I come upon this--I be not disappointed!! I have some cook chicken breast to use so I decide to slice them and place them on the top--this recipe be simple, easy and impressive enough to serve guests. Thanks for a great taste recipe Richard! (Even Grace enjoy it!) Yummmm! Must be the easiest, quickiest 5 star meal ever!  What an amazingly simple and yet tasty side dish! We really enjoy this and it go perfectly with the bacon wrap loaf recipe#8110 that I made. I use Roasted Red Peppers #18589 instead of jar and next time I will just slice them into sliver instead of blend them a they do not blend well a they be not soak in oil. I will use this recipe again soon. Thanks :) It be so easy and delicious....great to make during the week when time be limited.....Thank you.... This be a beautiful pasta dish. Would look great on a buffet. I find this by search for healthy low sodium recipes, but it can\\'t be healthy or low sodium since it use a jar of roast red pepper and a container of spreadable cheese! Quick, easy, inexpensive & taste great! Wouldn\\'t change a thing and will make again for a quick meatless meal or side dish.  This be fast and easy to put together. I\\'m not rat it though because I didn\\'t like the sauce and I don\\'t think it\\'s because of the recipe. Very tasty.  The spreadable cheese make a very nice sauce.  I use a \"light\" spreadable cheese and it work just fine.  I make this a a main dish by add asparagus and grill chicken to the recipe. This recipe be delicious.  I wasn\\'t quite sure of how big of a container be suppose to be use for the garlic & herb spreadable cheese so I just pick up a 12 oz one.  We end up use 16 ounce of rotelle pasta instead of 12 ounce but about 2/3 of a Tablespoon of black pepper help make up for the low sauce:pasta ratio.  I definitely plan to make this delicious yet inexpensive and simple dish again. Just for my own records: I halve the recipe and use 8 oz. of Wegman\\'s Own Garlic and Herb Cheese Spread. It be disgusting, but I won\\'t rate the recipe because it be obviously the fault of the cheese, and use way too much of it. Could someone mention what spreadable cheese they use: what brand or where you buy it? I make this for Memorial Day and I be tell it be bland, I follow direction exactly.  It be barely touched. Where have this recipe be all my life?  I\\'m in love!  Made this last night for dinner alongside grill pork chop and a big green salad...guess which dish everyone ask for second and even thirds?  I end use a red pepper paste from Trader Joe\\'s and throw in some artichoke heart and it be a huge hit.  thank Richard! I love this recipe.  I actually use goat cheese instead of the garlic and herb spreadable cheese and it come out fantastic.  Thank you soooo much! WOW!! Incredible Taste!! So Easy! Even fussy kid enjoyed. Thanks! I think the success of this dish rely largely on select the right cheese.  While the cheese I used, garlic & chive, be nicely flavoured, the sauce be rather bland - I\\'d pulse the pepper & cheese together in the food processor - so I add some extra ingredients. I make the meal for two use penne, a 270 gram jar of roast red pepper and 200 gram of the cheese, up from 120 gram in an effort to impart more flavour.  I add a couple of tablespoon of oil from the red peppers, one teaspoon of chilli flakes, one teaspoon of Italian herb and lot of freshly  crack black pepper,  top the finish dish with freshly grate parmesan.  Next time I\\'ll try use goat\\'s cheese.  As make today, we rate it 3.5. LOVED LOVED LOVED THIS RECIPE!!!!! I buy a container of already cook grill chicken and just throw it in with the pasta for the last minute of cook to heat it up, and it be incredible!!!! SO SO SO SO SO easy!!! can\\'t say enough how easy and delicious this is! wish i have some now. Richard do have great recipes. thank you, richard! WOW! If I could, you\\'d get more stars!!! DELICIOUS, AND EASY!!\\r\\n\\r\\nUsed sweet roast red peppers, Philidelphia CC and Rotini. Kids LOVED it. Served with Steak. My boyfriend and I absolutely love this recipe. It be easy to make and so very delicious. I will definitely be make this again soon. Thank you, Richard. This be a really easy recipe and yummy to boot. I can think of ton of possible add-in too, thanks! Super easy and sooo good!  I love it, thank you! A very simple and tasty little dish. I add saute onion and mushrooms...the leftover taste even good the next day or two! Thanks for this one. I have a jar of fire roast red and yellow pepper I\\'ve be try to use forever! This recipe do the trick. It only take me about 15min. from start to finish.  While I cook the pasta I make the sauce in another pan. It be good for a quick no fuss meal. Thanks! SO SO SO SO simple and equally delicious! I use a reduce fat Bousin garlic and herb cheese spread and it still have ton of flavor. I\\'ll be make this again and again. While I originally think I would branch out and try this with roast red pepper like the recipe call for, I just could not be so brave. So, I substitute a can of roast tomato for the peppers. This be so yummy - and very easy! (I know this totally defeat the whole title of the recipe, so I will try it again with the red peppers.) I think this be really good.  I use a 12oz jar of Mezzetta roast bell pepper and a 6.5oz container of Philadelphia Parmesan with Garlic & Herb Cracker Spreads. I LOVE this recipe. It\\'s a great foundation; I often add grind and/or olive to the whole thing, and often add some fresh basil and spice to the sauce. One time, add some olive to the sauce; very interesting.\\n\\nbtw, Annette NC: It\\'s roast red bell peppers; they have some flavor, but no heat. Really easy and delicious!  I use regular cream cheese and add some garlic powder, chives, dill weed , pepper and some season salt.  I put it ALL in the blender with about 2 T of water - perfect!  heat the sauce and add some parmesan at the end right before add to the pasta - husband love it too!  Thanks for a great recipe. This dish turn out kind of blah. It need some sort of spicy kick or more flavor. We use Philadelphia garlic and chive cream cheese (the smaller, normal size container 3.5oz I think) and Mancini brand of peppers. \\n\\nThe outcome of the recipe be probably dependent on what cheese you use and how much. I wish the recipe mention what size of container of cheese to use and/or specify what type (cream cheese? any type of spreadable cheese?). Good and easy weeknight meal.  Agree with some of the other raters though, it\\'d be nice to know how big of a container for the cheese.  Thanks for post I make this for dinner tonight and the kid and I all like it.  I also wish I have a little more direction with the ingredients.  I use an 8 ounce container of chive and onion cream cheese, a 12 ounce jar of roast red peppers.  I process the two together in the blender and then add just a little of the oil that the pepper be pack in to give it more of the red pepper flavor.  I add some cooked, dice chicken that I season with italian season and some mushrooms.  It make a nice main dish.  Thanks for the recipe. This be a great recipe.  I add some cook chicken piece to the sauce and double the ingredients.  I think the author mean a cheese like Boursin.  I use the light version of this cheese and it come out great.  Thanks for share Very tasty for a two ingredient sauce!  I use regular cream cheese because it be more economical and I use garlic powder, black pepper and a bite of sea salt for spunk - you could add whatever you feel like to it.  I prefer the chunkiness so just cut up the red pepper instead of put it in the blender. I agree that you could use this a a dip for a multitude of things.  Thanks for post such a simple and delicious recipe,  Richard-NYC. Very good! I use 16oz of red pepper and use 1/2 of a spreadable cheese and a container of Philadelphia cook cream (Italian herb), add come chicken and green pepper strip for extra veggie and protein. This will be make it&#039;s way into our regular dinner rotation.',\n",

I do not scoop enough of the bread out, so my fill escape in transit - to the bottom of the garden for a picnic! LOL! However, the taste be SUBLIME! What a wonderful combination of flavour and textures! I love this - and it certainly hit to spot for an al fresco lunch today! Made for the French All Aboard challenge in the To Go forum on behalf of Whine and Cheesers! Merci Sage darlink! FT:-) This be an excellent sandwich!!  I make this for ZWT5 French/Cajun and bring it to a baseball game for DH and myself, and we both love it.  It\\'s kind of a lot of work for a sandwich, but it\\'s totally unique and absolutely delish!  The only change I make be use fresh basil instead of dried.  Thanks! This be one of those sandwich that make you go \\'ooh la la\\'. Yes, it be more work than normal for a sandwich but then it really isn\\'t a normal sandwich.  My only real main change be to scale this right down and have mine on a small baguette just the right size for one person. Then, I use reduce fat version of the cheese, milk and mayo.  I wasn\\'t sure if I should be use basil or parsley because it say one in the ingredient and another in the directions. So, I use a bite of both - fresh in both cases. I also use a tiny bite of reduce fat creme fraishe in place of some of the mayo because I be run low on mayo.  It work well.  Made for Chow Hounds on ZWT5. I think this be excellent & will definitely be make it again. I can see it in slice on an appetizer tray a well a travel for a picnic. I use small whole wheat hoagy & reduce the amount of ham a what I have in the freezer be smoked. I also use a salt free tomato-basil season and no mayo.  I end up with a creamy ham & spinach spread mound into whole wheat hoagies.  Yum! Made this a a picnic lunch when my SIL visit me a few day ago and we be on the road do what we do best-shopping!  Served with cornichons, a few olive and a thermos of black coffee.  She request the same when next we go out for the day.  Thanks for share a great sandwich.  Made for ZWT5. This make a delicious sandwich and be so easy to put together! I love pistachio but hubby hat them so I use pine nut instead which work well. Made for ZWT5.',\n",
       " ' This be a big hit tonight for our Sunday night \" breakfast for dinner\".  Used our home make maple syrup, I scoop the biscuit dough with the cookie scoop a suggest and they be a great size.  Really tasty and a nice change of pace. Biscuits come out of the pan, but top be bake on the bottom and be difficult to scrape it out and drop it on top of the biscuits. The top be good, but get it off the bottom of the <br/>pan be a lot of much work. These be EXCELLENT!  I just love the maple and the bacon together, what a great combo!  The biscuit be great too.  Might make them just a biscuit sometime without the top too.  I didn\\'t have any trouble get them out of the pan, not bake on at all.  I love the recipe, and will be make this again!  Thanks for posting.',\n",
       " ' The cake be wonderful.  I always have a difficult time find layer cake that my husband will like; he find most too sweet, especially the frosting.  I make this for his birthday and we both love it.  It be very fudgy and dense, but not too sweet.  The only caveat be that I find the ice difficult to spread neatly.  When I make it, it be fairly liquid and thin.  It run down off the cake layer like a glaze and puddle up on the plate.  Luckily I have make a bite extra and have put paper plat under the cake to catch the excess.  I also should add that I seem to be quite mechanically challenge when it come to ice cakes, so a more experience baker probably would have have le difficulty.  Anyway, a the cake and ice sat/chilled, the ice firm up to a fabulous chewy fudge without that real sweet taste find in a lot of frostings. It also harden into an almost candy like glaze that be very pretty.  So definitely this recipe go into the \"make again-- and again-- and again\" file!  Thanks for post something different for all those out there who don\\'t like overly sweet dessert (and those of u who bake for them).  The combination of not-too-sweet and decadently chocolate be unbeatable! Very moist and fudgy.  I be hop for a dense cake but it be quite delicious nevertheless.  The only change I make to the recipe be I substitute with semisweet chocolate cuz I didn\\'t have any unsweetened on hand.  My bake time also take much long than the recipe indicate (close to 40 minutes).  For the frost I stick it in the fridge for about an hour to solidify it, then use the beater on it to turn it into a fluffy spread.  Will keep this recipe to make into cupcake next time. This be the perfect cake.  My daughter and I call it the \"Matilda Cake\" because it remind u of the huge chocolate cake the evil schoolmaster lady make the boy eat in it entirety in the movie Matilda!  Ooey gooey chocolatey goodness.  I\\'m not a big fan of buttery rich frosting, so this really fit the bill with it simple whip cream and melt chocolate glaze.  Yes, it be a little drippy when you\\'re frost it, but it all work out in the end.  A wonderfully moist cake.  I didn\\'t realize the egg be suppose to be at room temperature until after I start make it, and the cake turn out just fine.  I love this recipe! I love this recipe.  The cake be very intensely chocolate but NOT overly sweet.  I give some to my Mom who felt the same way - she say I should make this cake all the time.  Even the fudgy drippy ice be great, maybe the next time I\\'ll let it firm up some before put it up the cake.',\n",
       " ' This be a super wonderful cake that taste a great a it sounds! I use low-fat plain yogurt a a substitute for the sour cream and make this cake. It be a big treat and go well with everyone! Thank you so much for share the recipe! This be delicious!!!! Really moist, tasty, incredible...! I make it for a friend who doesn\\'t like cinnamon, so I leave out most of it, and add a little grate lemon peel and a bite more vanilla for  flavouring; also, like Charishma, I use low-fat plain yoghurt instead of sour cream and low-fat milk instead of buttermilk (they\\'re not so easy to find here in Italy), but it still be wonderful, and with a little le fat, I suppose! The only little problem be with the cook time: this little friend never seem to cook and be in the oven for about 1 hour 15 minute before setting...but this wasn\\'t really a problem, and it give me more time to set my camera and take a picture of this not only good taste but also very pretty cake! This cake turn out very moist. I do not have sour cream on hand so I to have use yoghurt. \\r\\n It take exact 45 min to bake. The top start to burn so I have to cover it with foil and bake  the last 15 min.It still taste wonderful. Lovely cake! Topped mine simply with flake almond and bake it in a 9in springform tin. Quite enormous... but survive freeze well (2people, huge cake), should you need to do it. This be actually an easy recipe to make! I didn\\'t have enough apple - so I mix in some raisins. I double the recipe, a I usually do since I bake for many. I end up with 2 9\" round springform pans. Since I bake them at the same time - it too a bite long to bake. I would say altogether about an hour and 15 minutes. The house smell delicious. the ironic part be Mr. Dutchy and I can\\'t eat any since we be fasting! I will have to rely on my co-worker to let me know how good they are! They be beautiful - just like the picture above Great cake! My hubby like it and he be not a sweet kind a  guy. A friend of ours have make this for a church potluck and when I ask her for the recipe she say she couldnt because it be the family recipe, so I do the next best thing - I come to the \"zaar\". I also think that this cake come out better. Thanks for post it! This be a very lovely coffee cake.  My whole family really like it.  I will be  make it again soon.  Thanks for posting. Wonderful! Thanks so much for sharing. This be a keeper. I halve the recipe in a 9x9 and all go fine. The only nut I have leave in the house be a small bag of mix nut (cashews, walnuts, pecans, almonds) I really like how it turn out though! Only change I\\'d make be to add another apple next time. The batter be very thick, I wonder if I\\'d leave something out, but it turn out perfectly. Somehow this cake be dense and fluffy at the same time! I love it, so do Mom, who\\'s rediculously picky these days. This go right into the \" can\\'t go wrong - company recipes\" catagory. A lovely moist coffee cake with nice flavor.

Excellent rice dish. I love it! When I read the ingredient I know I have to try it, cause I love broccoli and rice. Easy to make and so tasty. Next time I'm go to use a large onion.

Thanks for such a flavorful yet easy recipe! very good and easy.  love that it do not include any can soup.  I sprinkle more cheddar on top and broil for a minute or two, yummy!  In the future I would consider some mushroom and cauliflower. Husband love it too. I steam the broccoli and use brown rice.  Used a leek and the sharp cheddar; add 1/2 tsp salt.  We felt it be good, but need more flavor.  This would be great with some more add seasoning, maybe fresh garlic and more salt?  Made for Kid Friendly tag. I make this for my husband all the time.  I know he love when he pas up the mash potato (his fav) for second of this casserole.  I usually cut back the cheese a bite and increase the broccoli and it be still very rich and flavorful.  It be also fine with freeze broccoli florets, a long a they be good quality.  Thanks! Thank you so much for post a recipe that didn't use can soup or jar cheese! It's a terrific recipe. I just add a little bite more seasonings. \\r\\nThanks again! This be very good! I've eat it at restaurant before but never try to make it at home until now. I use freeze broccoli instead of fresh.

I have this for lunch yesterday and again today, a perfect lunch for hot weather when one doesn't want anything too heavy but still have something nourishing.  Even my husband like it.  Thanks for share this terrific recipe! I really enjoy this wrap. I have use it for dinner and lunch with some side and it's always a big hit. Only thing I change be I add a little more spinach. So simple, but soooooo good. :) I use atheno's hummus and a fat free tortilla. This be great when I didn't want a heavy meal but a light snack. The olive oil really add some nice flavor. Thanks for a great keeper! I love this wrap! The spinach be such a nice touch (versus the usual lettuce). I use one chop green onion instead of the regular onion. This be a simple and quick recipe that can be easily make for to go lunches. Thank you! Nice wrap. I take other reviewers&#039; suggestion and use more fill and sub green onions. I also add some basil and artichoke heart since I have them, and use olive hummus (therefore skip the olive oil). The flavor be all really great together.\",\n",
       " \" Very tasty.  I use the green tortilla (spinach?  I think?) instread of tomato-basil.  Served with orange breakfast rolls. WOW!!  These be just fabulous....who would have think such simple ingredient would make such an incredible breakfast sandwich.  My DH just love them!  The only thing I do differently be to add some dry chive instead of chop onions.  I also use wheat tortilla (that's what I have on hand).  This be definitely a keeper.  Thanks VickyJ!!!! look like a desert when I 1st saw it. This recipe be ok I only give it 3 star because I be not crazy about warm or hot tomatoes, and the egg make the tortilla a little mushy so I grill the sandwich on a cast iron skillet for a couple seconds, it work out really well,, thank-you Good idea. I make pico de gallo and put the scramble egg, pico de gallo, bacon, cheese and roll them up. This be a keeper and have plenty of flavor! Oh, this be one of my go-to lunch wraps, but I use some salsa instead of the tomatoes... and I nuke them to speed up the cook process. Just wrap the assemble wrap in paper towel (seam side up) and put in the microwave at 50% power for about 20-30 second (increase by 10 second intervals, until the cheese be melted), unwrap and enjoy! You do have to adjust the time accord to the ingredient you used. Very good with sausage, too, but cook it first before add to the wrap.\",\n",
       " \" This bread turn out great, it's a HUGE improvement over the original no-knead that go around awhile ago. The dough be firm and easy to work with. The parchment trick make it very easy to shape and get in the pot. I use my 5 quart crock pot liner and glass lid to bake, work fine. I forget to slash the top but that be fine too, not a fancy look I guess. I've make this a few time already.  It make great bread!  The only problem be that it doesn't last long!  I think the beer and vinegar give it a little more flavor than the simple flour, salt and water recipe (which I have try a well.).  This be definately a keeper. I agree with Monstr - this turn out SO much good than the regular no-kneads!  I follow the original ATK instruction (3/4 c. water, 1/2 c. beer) but increase the yeast to 1/2 t. since I only have regular yeast.  For bake I use a 10-inch cast iron pot with 3 1/2--inch sides.  The loaf rise so much that it hit the lid!  It turn out with a beautiful super-crispy crust and look just like the artisanal loaf I see at the store!  My loaf be already golden brown when I take the lid off after 30 minute so another 15 be all that be need to produce a deep brown crust.  I be so impress I just buy a big cast iron pot on Amazon so my future loaf have a much room a they need.  Excellent!! This recipe produce the tasty and pretty loaf of bread I have ever made. I have make it at least six times, and it have turn out well every single time. A great fool-proof recipe for novice bakers.\",\n",
       " \" The thing I love most about one-serving recipe be that, unlike when I scale down recipe to 1 serving, I don't have to worry about adjust cook time and temperatures. The instruction in this recipe be absolutely perfect! It's important to cut the carrot into juilenne strips, or they won't be done. I didn't have orange rind, so I use a drop of orange extract instead, and it taste great! I also add a sprinkle of salt at the end. I will make this all the time from now on...\",\n",

Makes for a great presentation- I would imagine this would be a big hit with kids, too, but it still a bite more sophisticate than pizza, I think.  We make ours with pepperoni, chop salami (didn\\'t have much pepperoni) and slice crimini mushrooms.  Very tasty.  I use my favorite pizza dough- s\\'kat\\'s Easy Pizza Dough (#16331) ;-)  It be great.  We have it for dinner with some extra sauce pour over top (I be afraid make the loaf itself quite saucy would also make it leaky...) and a green salad.  Very good.  I have one qualm with the recipe, though: \"1/4 package\" mozzarella be not a good measure.  Very easy (once you know how to make pizza dough), very tasty and just plain fun.  I admit, though, I make this on a Friday, not a Monday... luckily it be still great.  Thanks for posting.     We always use this method for defatting the pepperoni before we put it on our regular pizza now.  Thanks for post this!

Thank you so much for posting, I love it!! I agree that this doesn\\'t need anymore endorsement but, boy, this stuff be GOOD!!  I really think it be good than the name brand stuff!  Hubby be make it at his meat store/deli and sell for 8.99/pound and can\\'t keep it in stock!  As fast a they make it customer buy it!  Excellent. With my bagel experiment lately I think this would make a nice spread. So good this is.  My chive aren\\'t quite up in the garden yet so I have to use a bite of green onion instead, and I halve the recipe a well, still use the 3T of Parm. Reggiano.  Just divine, thank you for share this. The flavor be spot on...I love boursin and so I feel like a winner be able to pull this off...the texture isn\\'t the same but like I say the flavor be spot on. Never have or make boursin cheese before this, but it be delicious!  I find the butter a tad hard to mix in even at room temperature, but keep at it until it be nice and smooth. I make only half a batch and find it make plenty! We prefer bread over cracker with this cheese, but either way, it\\'s good. Thank you for posting. Perfect!  I need some boursin cheese for a recipe I be make and didn\\'t want to run to the store for it.  I make your recipe and it work perfectly.  I have leftover cheese so serve it the next day with cracker and my family devour it.  Thank you for save me a trip to the store and for share your recipe. This be just wonderful. I make half a batch for a recipe and we use leftover on bread. YUMMY! Thank you for share this great recipe. Too good!  I halve the recipe and use some extra spices.  I will probably use a little le butter next time.  Very rich and delicious.\\nServed on a toast baguette with thinly slice tomato and cucumbers.  Thanks. AWESOME stuff!!!! I use garlic chive (what I have grow outside) and didn\\'t use the rest of the herbs.  How can it not be good, butter AND cream cheese...... Will never buy Rondele again, this RAWKS. I use several roast garlic clove for extra flavor and omit the dill. Next time, I will also add a bite of pesto. In keep with my low carb WOE,  I use this to stuff tiny sweet mini peppers, a a spread between slice of stack salami, and spread on lc tortilla for a wrap appetizer. Eveleyn, simply superb!! When I first start cooking, I use this same recipe (only with much large measure units) for Stuffed Mushroom Marinara although I omit the marjoram. I cook at a four-star restaurant, and it be such a hit. Clients be always ask u about the \"delicious stuff\" in the mushrooms. They have no idea that be so inexpensive to make. We also use it to spread on flat bread and even put a bite in the French Onion Soup. This recipe be GREAT! I use it for everything now. This be so yummy!!!! I be so excite when I saw this recipe.  I always have boursin cheese at my grandparent house for Christmas. One of their neighbor would make it and put it in mug for christmas.  After my grandparent pas away i never have it again til now!  this taste the same and I be make tripple the recipe right now :) OMG. I just make this for Christmas Eve and have to taste it. Delicious. My family be go to go crazy when they taste this! Much good than store bought. I think this be delicious!  I have to try a couple before put in the frig. to chill.  What a great appetizer with crackers. EXCELLENT! My son and his partner be home from NY and they eat over half of it themselves! Thanks for a great recipe. Delicious, Evelyn, simply delicious.  It taste very similar to Boursin.  I love it.  Quick and easy to make. Very easy to halve.  I make enough for myself to have a tasty sandwich. I use a good quality fresh vienneise bun, Caliente Salami and your boursin recipe.  What a terrific  lunch it made.  Thanks for sharing.  Made for Pool Party Tag :) Just make this one and love it already.  Got frustrate after Sam\\'s Club stop sell my favorite cheese spread twice.  I decide to figure out how to make it myself.  I never figure it have the butter in it though.  I like it spread on Kame Oriental Rice Crackers. I have make this many time and love this recipe!  So much le expensive than the premade stuff!  I have find it keep well in the refrigerator too.  Great to have on hand. Can you stand another rave review of this recipe? Simply fabulous! I need some Boursin for a recipe, but couldn\\'t find any here in our small town. It\\'s time like these, I\\'m thankful for Zaar (Food. com) contributors. :) LOVE this stuff! The fresh parmesan and parsley really kick it up. I usually add a bite more garlic and sometimes I use an asiago or mix cheese blend if that be what I have on hand. It always come out tasty, whether I be use it in a recipe or just for snacking.  Thanks for posting, Ev!  : ) And  . . . here\\'s another rave review. I join this board just so I could add my voice - this be an absolutely fabulous recipe. I serve it on French bread toast and, a suggested, with Cooking Light\\'s Tomato-Basil soup.The soup be OK, but the toast be out of this world! This stuff be great.  I use all dry season instead of fresh because it\\'s the middle of winter and I have no garden available and 1/2 tsp. garlic powder instead of the clove.  I let it sit overnight in the frig and serve this on a toast everything bagel.  This will for sure be get make again.  Thanks for this fast easy and tasty recipe. I use this recipe a a substitute for the boursin cheese call for in Bacon Wrapped Boursin Stuffed Chicken Breasts - a Deux!  It be wonderful!  I prepare 12 chicken breast and still have some of the cheese leave over. I make the chicken ahead of time and freeze it. I then thaw and bake some of it for for Mother\\'s Day. I would certainly recommend this recipe and would not hesitate to use it again. Everyone love it! I have never try Boursin.  I need the cheese to stuff mushrooms. I haven\\'t bake the mushroom yet but my family be really enjoy the cheese now.. Thank You So Much  :-) What be the shelf life of this?  I make this and it be so simple.  Delicious recipe!  I love it. Alright I have to add another,  10 star review!!!!  AMAZING!  It be so expensive to buy Boursin and now I\\'ll never have to again!!  Thank you, thank you, thank you evelyn/athens !!!!! Must try it stuff in mushrooms, mmmmmmm I have make this several times, it be a fabulous cheese spread that taste very similar to Boursin. This time use only half of the butter amount and substitute the other half with Ricotta to make it a little low in kalories. Worked great, couldn\\'t tell the difference. Thanks for a wonderful recipe, evelyn! I use the herb combo (no butter, cream cheese, Parm and add salt) to season some home-made whole-milk ricotta that I made. Tastes great just after mix bet it will be even good tomorrow! We make this for family gather all the time. So much le expensive than buy the store buy type and it taste exactly the same. If anything, it\\'s tastier. Thank you! This be way good than the stuff you buy in the store. I leave out the marjoram a I didn\\'t have any and cut everything in half and it be awesome. I find this recipe while browse and OH Boy be it great. The only problem be the clove of garlic be large and I should only use one clove---it\\'s garlicky. The next time I\\'ll only use one cleave if they be large.  I LOVE boursin and this be a keeper.  Good job!!!   Thank you for a jo0b well done. This be a VERY delicious cream cheese spread, but it be hardly a boursin recipe. Boursin melt on the tongue like ice cream, and this doesn&#039;t even come close. Good on a bagel or a potato gratin recipe, but this really isn&#039;t a substitute for the real thing. If you need it for a recipe it would be ok, but on a proper cheese platter; this just won&#039;t fly. Nice try though. Great fast recipe that do not reveal it humble components. Used a a base for sliver saute mushroom on little rye toast and with lox on pumpernickel and dice roast beet sprinkle with dill on either with fabulous results. My mistake be make only a 1/2 batch. A real sleeper keeper, especially over the holidays! Now to make a second full batch for the fridge -  a perfect thing to pull out when friend drop in unexpectedly! This be a fine recipe, but  aggghhhhh! Two garlic clove be wayyy too much! (unless you really love overwhelm garlic taste - I like garlic btw) I try again with half a garlic clove, and that be MORE than enough. I have try this with goat cheese instead of the butter - cut down on the calorie (and you forego some of the richness), give the nice tangy flavor of goat cheese instead. Which not everyone likes, of course... Huge success at our potluck - I run out of crackers, and folk be steal them from others&#039; offer to snack on this. I mince the fresh dill, parsley and garlic and scallion instead of chive with my immersion blender, then chunk the cheese and butter, throw everything into the KitchenAid and let it mix. It turn out perfect! Many request for the recipe. I&#039;ve make this any number of time and it&#039;s always great, even though I do all those bad thing I shouldn&#039;t: I use cheap parmesan from the green jar (I know, boo! to me), a well a 1 tsp dry dill and 2 tsps dry parsley. I crush the dry herb up together in a small mortar and pestle before adding. I&#039;ve use it a a spread for crackers, pita bread or baguettes, and also toss hot pasta with it, which be really yummy. I have make this a the cheese, but I have also use the spice with buttermilk and a little mayo to make Ranch dressing. Delicious! I love real Boursin cheese but I&#039;m on a budget.  This be delightful and very cost friendly.  My family be not familiar with it but they be fan now.  I&#039;m store it in glass pint jar in the refrigerator.  Thank you so much for the recipe. I simplify the recipe a bite by use a store brand Italian Seasonings blend instead of the individual spices. I use 8 oz of cream cheese, 4 oz of butter, 1 clove of garlic, 3 Tbsp shred Parmesan, 2 Tbsp fresh parsley, and 1 1/2 tsp of the Italian Seasoning. It taste just like that expensive Boursin in the supermarket! I\\'m sure it will be even good after a day in the fridge. I use half the amount of butter, and use granulate garlic. Because I be gift with smoke salmon for Xmas, I also add chop caper So glad I find this! Came here to find recipe with this cheese but get this instead. I buy some boursin cheese this weekend think it be brie. It be very good. Going to make some tomorrow. This be REALL GOOD!!! I make it with cream goat cheese and even better! One of my sibling bring some Boursin cheese to a beach vacation this past year and my wife fell in love with it. When we return home, she go shop for it and couldn\\'t believe it be about $6 for a little over five ounce so I go on a quest to find a good recipe for it. And I find it here. This recipe make a LOT, about five time more than what you would buy in the store, for le than the store price. My whole family say this be definitely a keeper. It make so much for just the three of u at home that I halve the recipe. I be make a new batch tonight. Thanks for a great recipe!!! I give it five stars! The first recipe that I had, call for a bite of dry white wine, which I add and it make it that much more &quot;special&quot;.',\n",
       " \" Excellent!!!! Great soup! It's no secret that we be soup lovers, we really enjoy this version of Hamburger soup - it have be add to my soup collection. I find those 'mothers favorites' make for great choice when choose a recipe. Thank you Sheynath and thank your mother - it make for a lovely supper soup. We enjoy this soup for a nice dinner last night.  I cook in the crock pot for 8 hours.  I add northern bean instead of butter bean a DH do not like them.   After a taste, we decide to add some hot sauce to our bowl and it add just the zip that we needed.  Thanks for share this nice and easy recipe Sheynath.  Made for Aussie Swap #17. What a delicious soup Sheynath. I make it this morning and it simmer for 8 hours. The smell in the house be terrific...but the soup taste even better. I do decrease the amount of sugar and like happynana we add a shoot of habanero hot sauce to the finish soup.  Thank you so much for share this recipe, into my keeper box it goes. Very good!! I simmer it on the stovetop for a couple hour instead of use the crockpot.\",\n",
       " ' This be really tasty! I actually use \"normal\" tomato and an onion instead of the shallot. I love the combination of tomato and goat cheese so this recipe be definitely one I\\'ll use again!',\n",
       " ' Fabulous!! I have trouble get lamb loin or fillet and have to resort to leg of lamb and cut it up. The flavour be just right..a bite salty and softly sour. Will make this again and then use pork loin, Im sure it will work with that too! ',\n",
       " \" This great recipe be very easy to make and come out of the oven look moist and beautiful!\\r\\nThe contrast between sweet (bananas & sugar) a oppose to the salsa be excellent! I admit it. This recipe look strange enough to be intrigue & I do love salsa, so I take a leap of faith. I make a half recipe in an 8x3x3 aluminum loaf pan & make 1 minor chg by add the salsa after all else be combine in the hope part of the salsa solid would stay intact & be visible in the finish loaf. I watch it like a hawk a my convection oven cook hot & fast + I have no clue how to adjust the bake time. It seem to be brown fast, so I tent it at 20 min, check it at 40 min & at 50 min it be do & nicely brown. At 60 min, it get photograph & at 70 min be be enjoyed. This bread be great, Redsie - the perfect balance of sweet & savoury. I hope a lot of people take the same leap of faith & try your recipe. Thx for share it w/us. I didn't know what to expect with this, and I be pleasantly surpised! You can really taste the salsa, I use medium heat and the heat come through in the bread. I have to cook it about 1 hour 45 minute to get it do all the way through. The outside be dark, but not at all burnt, more like carmelized. Yum! Thank you! When I saw this I think it look like such a weird combination that I just have to try it and I'm so glad I did!  I cut the sugar down to about half a cup and I still think it be sweet enough.  It come out so moist and it taste delicious.  I bake mine for a hour and it come out perfect.  Great recipe!\",\n",

Me, sometimes I like a nice plain treat, & other time I enjoy a full blast of sweetness! I also didn't flatten them much, & that make for some wonderfully chewy, great taste cookies!

They be go on my comfort food list. So easy to make. The only problem be I think I will need to double the recipe next time. They disappear so fast!!! I think they would be good with a little peanut butter throw in also. Yummy! The kid be love these.  I have always make the \"old\" version of these stave top cooky which do not contain the marshmallows.  I think the marshmallow give the cooky a good texture.  If anyone be use mini marshamallows, I guess at about 1 3/4 - 2 Cups and that seem to work right.\\r\\nThanks for a quick recipe Susie cooks! I take this to the DS\\'s recreation group and it be enjoy for morning tea and finish off in the afternoon at a staff meeting.

       " ' I know this would be great it\\'s from Kittencal and it was! not good it be fantastic, a always yours recipe be simply the best, thank Kit. Delicious! Made the receipe a post with corn but also throw in a handful of freeze peas. Personal preference I think I would just use pea next time. Served over the puff patty shells. A very fill receipe that look and taste great. Using the leftover tonight over broad egg noodles. I can\\'t wait to try this with leftover turkey. Thanks! Ok!!! Wow! This be like no other chicken a La King I have ever had. Absolutely outstanding! My husband love it - finish off everything that I didn\\'t eat. :) I only use pea in the recipe - no corn. I alos reduce the garlic to two teaspoons. Thank you for post this. Incredible! FABULOUS!  Thank you for yet ANOTHER wonderful recipe!  I will make again!  xo LA :-) What a great way to use my leftover turkey, i have pea and corn leftover from thanksgiving, so both of those go in. I pour it into a casserole dish and top it with a layer of refrigerater crescent rolls, and bake for 30 min at 325. everyone in my family love this. Kittencal this be great!  Very easy. I use pea and serve it over texas toast like you suggest and it be a nice change. The kid love it too! I will definiely be make this again. Thanks! I haven\\'t make Chicken a la King for year and I choose this recipe because it be similar to the one that I use in the past! I make a couple of minor change which I\\'m sure would not affect the outcome. I saute a chop onion at step 1, use half & half to reduce the fat, add freeze (but thawed) mushroom & corn at step 5 and omit the pimento a I didn\\'t have. I prepare the recipe early in the day & reheat in a double boiler while I be bake some freeze patry shells. Dinner be delicious - the flavour of the sauce be strengthen by the bouillon. when repeat this recipe, I would choose freeze pea but only to add colour to the dish. Thanx for another good one Carol! Delicious! Loved it!  Added onion like another recipe had, and it be good. This be so good -- and we use MILK!!! The whole family love it, and it be a great and easy way to use leftover turkey. We serve it over thick French bread. Wouldn\\'t change a thing. Thanks, Kittencal! I make this for my husband for dinner and he really enjoy it! I add pea and instead of pimiento I use red bell pepper. Thank you Kitten for a dish that will be repeated! I use pea instead of corn.  Delicious! This be not your basic Chicken a La King. The taste be superb-simple enough for my family, but superb enough to serve for company. Served this over puff pastry shells. Delicious! This taste very similar to something my German mother would make call \"Huehner Frickasee\". I love that it have so much flavor! I don\\'t use bouillon cub (msg sensitivity) so I boil the chicken in chicken stock and then use the \"juices\" in the pot for the chicken stock in the recipe. I also add two bay leave for flavor and it turn out wonderfully without the cube. Also I use can asparagus instead of pimento simply because I like asparagus and I have it one hand and I think it go really well with this recipe. Thank you for post this- you always have incredibly delicious recipe :) I use onion instead of mushrooms, 1/2 tsp of pepper, milk, peas, no pimiento, and serve it over puff pastry rounds. For our tastes, I be glad I didn&#039;t add any additional pepper!  I think next time I may also leave out the parmesean--to me, it didn&#039;t taste quite like Chicken a La King with that flavor included. Thanks for a quick and easy dinner! Very good!  It be a winner with the kids.  Used leftover turkey and milk instead of cream, but will definitely make it again.  If you add bow tie pasta, it would taste a lot like the Bertolli Chicken Florentine dinner (just need to add some freeze spinach with the veggies.) Wow, thank for share Kitten.  I choose to make this because it be similar to one I make.  My dh be a very picky guy and he love this. What&#039;s not to like ... it be awesome, rich, silky, smooth, full of flavor, great textures.  The perfect comfort dish.  Made a write but omit the red pepper and pimentos, I do  add some pan fry sweet onions. I will be make this again.  Thanks for make our turkey leftover taste great.   Made for What&#039;s on the Menu?  Tag Game This be very tasty. I use both pea and corn and serve over rice. I do need to add about 1/2 - 1 cup more chicken broth than call for in the recipe. I would definitely make this again. Thanks for sharing.',\n",
       " ' I halve the recipe and use Bob Evans Savory Sage sausage.  It be very easy to make but I have to add more milk because it be too thick (around 1/2 - 3/4 cup more).  I think I would use a little le flour because it have a slight floury aftertaste but it be a very good sausage gravy.  I like have it over biscuits, scramble egg and home fries.

Both myself and DH love this salad for dinner tonight, this salad be very fill so no need for anything else with it! Thank you for share this great recipe Nims!...Kitten:) A delicious salad that be pack full of good things.  The combination of fruit, vegetable and seed couple with the tart dress and cheese provide a very please combination.  Thank you for share this wonderful recipe. I usually don\\'t like fruit in my green salads, but it really work here. DBF love this, rat it 5+ stars, which be high praise from him. I find the dress to be a little too sweet for my tastes, so I may cut back on the honey next time. The only real change I make be to use dry cranberry instead of raisins. The apricot didn\\'t travel so well to class, so I may use dry next time if I won\\'t be eat it right away. Thanks for post Nimz! This make a fantastic lunch for me today! I love the addition of apricot and green apples, since I have plenty of them. I halve this recipe since it be just for me. I will have the rest tomorrow! Thanks for posting. I really enjoy this.  I love spinach salad and really enjoy the addition of apple and apricots.  Plus the familiar combination of sunflower seed and broccoli make this great.  My only change would be to reduce the amount of honey in the dressing...I like my dress a little more \"balsalmic\".  Thanks for post a great salad!',\n",

A few small changes, dice tomato instead of sun dried, didn&#039;t have any and I freshly grind the  chinese five spice powder, for a beautiful mellow note. This be one of my personal favorite dishes, Good Luck in the Contest. What a fun combination of flavors!

Too delish to be light! I use all yogurt just add an 3T to the pint used. I buy nonfat yogurt by the truckload. Love the tart flavor and it be much low in fat and good for you than sour cream so I use it a a sub often.\\r\\n\\r\\nThis recipe be simply awesome! \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks Toni! A sensational recipe!  Both when I be make it and even more when eat it, it be really hard to believe that this recipe be SO low in fat.  I follow the recipe exactly, except for use only 2 tablespoon of sugar in step one – and use raspberry rather than strawberry – because I’d buy raspberry for another recipe, and because I prefer them to strawberries.  I generally cut back the sugar in recipes.  This recipe make eat such a dessert something that you don’t have to relegate to the “make only occasionally category” (in the interest of your health) and it be a recipe that you can confidently serve at a dinner party.  Unlike so many low fat recipes, it just doesn’t look or taste low fat.  Thanks toni! Delicious!!! The plain fat-free yogurt I use be very runny so I decide to drain it first for about 1/2 hour - be glad I did, and will drain even more the next time a I'd love an even thick texture. Great creamy taste with just a hint of tartness from the yogurt! Thanks for a great recipe! This be absolutely delicious, what a great summertime dessert! I make this use full-fat sour cream and I use Greek yogurt also I increase the confectioner sugar, we love this Toni, thank for share hon!...Kitten:) I love this dessert;I only put 1 tsp of sugar at the beginning.It be great...low fat but taste like you be cheating.Will make this one again.Thank you for sharing.

Its a keeper and now that strawberry be in season it my favorite dessert. Thanks for share another great recipe Toni! Wonderful - a guilt-free dessert.  I use low-fat Greek yoghurt.  This be very tasty and easy.  Definitely a 5-star recipe. This be so good I will make it again,and again A very nice alternative for dessert, would be good with other type of berry a well.

These be fabulous a is, but if you heat a bar in the microwave a few seconds, top with vanilla ice cream and a drizzle of chocolate syrup, you have a dessert tasty enough to be serve in a restaurant!

       " \" Awesome recipe! Superb taste and texture--the best homemade frijol I've have (and I live in CA). It only take 3.5 hour and by the time they be finished, all the liquid have be absorbed. They get a little dry when I refrigerate them, but add some water make them nice and creamy again.  I use bouillon concentrate paste, which be a bite saltier, so next time I'll reduce it to 2 tablespoon and up the bacon grease a bit. Very good. I brown some chorizo, a few slice of bacon, and then sweat an onion in the pot before add the beans. I will be make this often. I've use this recipe many times.  It's great taste and a simple to make a it gets! Had a surprise group of teen boy for dinner tonight so have to quick change what I be making.  Teen boy be not wild about cabbage rolls.  LOL!  Made a taco bake I find on Allrecipes and these bean to go with them.  My husband, who really be not fond of refried bean have 2nds.  Whoo hoo!  The boy did, too.  I didn't have any bacon grease, so just leave it out.  These be so good!  If any be left, we can have some bean enchilada for lunch tomorrow.  Thanks for a great very easy recipe that do not use can beans.  :) Good flavor for Mexican beans.  Mine take the full 6 hour to cook. Awesome recipe. I love refried beans, but I have always despise the can ones. I have try make this other ways, but the pan-fry method be too messy and the crock pot method just doesn't cut it for me taste-wise. With this, I could just stick my immersion blender right in and mash them. I didn't have boullion, so I use beer and chicken stock. I season with cayenne, adobo, and add lime juice and sour cream at the end. I cannot wait to eat the left-overs a bean burritos! DEEEEEEEEE-licious!  Cooked in under4 hours. This be absolutely WONDERFUL!  These be great!!! Perfect refried beans!  This be my first time make them and they be much good than canned. I add 1 tsp cumin also. I soak them overnight and all day and they only have to cook for about 3 hours. I have to add 4 cup of water to boil, no way would 2 be enough. I uncover the pot for the last 30 minute and they thicken just enough. Thanks! I try just to make some dry pinto bean in my pressure cooker for the first time and they come out so squishy that I just blend them all up in my food processor and then cook them with all your ingredients.  I add a little cumin and lime juice and I just can't quit eat it!\",\n",
       " \" Excellent! These be great taste gingersnaps. Made a post and wouldn't change a thing. Definitely a keeper. Thank you for posting. Yum!! These be a light crunchy cookie. \\r\\nDue to the high content of sugar in the cookie I didn't roll them in extra before bake and I substitute Golden Syrup for the Molasses.\\r\\nThanks for sharing! I be look for a gingersnap recipe that would taste like the cooky I use to get a a kid with my school lunch.  Not exactly the same, but tasty nonetheless! I do find that the dough need to be chill before form balls, have a heck of time with the first batch, refrigerate for about 30 minute and go back and complete the next three with no stickiness.  My first batch be devour by me 3 kid before I even put the second batch in! Did some without roll in sugar and some with... we prefer it with.\",\n",
       " ' Lovely spongelike apple cake. And a state not overly sweet.\\r\\nI use walnut for the top which be nice and crunchy, thank for posting. This cake really be yummy!  Not too sweet base with a crunchy, streusel-like nut topping.  A must-try. this be soooo good! the cake be rich and full of flavor, the top compliment it so well, different textures. i use a granny smith and a yellow delicious apple, our guest be rave about this. It be very tasty but I have trouble cut it evenly. Seemed a little too moist; perhaps I should have leave it in the oven a little longer. I would make a little more top next time and perhaps sprikle with powder sugar.  Great for a morning brunch offering. Definitely will make again. I use Granny Smiths and they work nicely; not too sweet. This be a flavourful cake that we enjoy very much.  I add about a 1/2 cup of raisin in the batter and use slice almond for the topping.  It be simple and delicious.  Thanks for the great recipe Kim. The batter for this cake be so yummy! It be so easy to make! I cut almost 4 cup of apple and throw them in anyway and it still come out great - although you have to be sure to bake it long enough so not to be mushy. I have more apple and sourcream to get rid of so i\\'ll be make it again! Wonderful moist apple cake with a crumb top that be to die for. This cake be pack with apple and sour cream to make it really moist. Only change I made, and it be not necessary but I add a little more brown sugar because I just want more topping. Great cake for anytime. The wonderful aroma of apple and cinnamon fill the air. Took this to the DS\\'s recreation music group day and it be an oustanding success, most be after a second slice and some be even stretch their luck and look for a 3rd.  I use walnuts, 2 large granny smith apple which give me about 2 1/2 cup of dice apple and bake at 170 degree celsius (fan force oven) for 30 minutes.  Thank you Kim127 for a keeper of a recipe.  Made for Recipe Swap #12 - January 2008. Absolutely wonderful cake! I have make this twice already a dessert for DH\\'s student advisee dinner so have to wait for the 2nd batch of students\\' opinion to post in my review. Everybody LOVED it! Very easy to put together and just like it say in the description, not overly sweet. I use golden delicious apple since that\\'s the only cook apple the local shop have this time but I definitely will try it with granny smith apple next time I get hold of them. I love the addition of the nut top which give a nice crunch. I add in chop almond for the nuts. Thank you, Kim127, for share this wonderful recipe, definitely will be make it again! WONDERFUL cake!  I take this to a get-together with about 10 friend and they be ALL ask for the recipe, so it be a hit!  We only have half a cup of sour cream in the fridge, so we also use some plain yogurt and a little lemon juice.  Thanks for this wonderful recipe.  Made for ZWT4 - Los Jefes de la Cocina. ZWT$ Mmmmm!! EXCELLENT! I love apple cake and this be a perfect one us!! WOW: this be just so delicious, and so very, very easy to make. It be Luvin\\' Texas\\' photograph that initially lure me to this recipe.  What I really appreciate in make it be Kim\\'s wonderfully clear instruction - really important if (like me) you don\\'t often make cakes!  I wouldn\\'t change a thing, and I\\'ll certainly be make this again... so thank you friend of a friend, and Kim for share this great recipe.  Made for Zaar Stars Tag, and this recipe certainly deserve it star status! Wow !! these be fantastic ! It make for a lovely dessert tonight.  Made the recipe without any changes.  A definate recommadation for one to try. YUMMY!! This be so good.  I have a piece a soon a it come out of the oven.  Scrumptious.  I know this will be a regular for me.  Thanks. I make the recipe exactly a written, except I use a smaller, deep bake dish (about 11x6), so it bake for a bite longer.  This be really delicious and the perfect way to use freshly pick apple from the orchard.  Thanks for post another winner, Kim!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game. Excellent cake. I wasn\\'t sure whether the apple be suppose to be peel or not, so I peel mine just in case. I use 8x8 pan and the result be a much fluffy cake than on the pic, I also have to increase bake time by a few minutes. I like this cake and I think it\\'s a perfect morning coffee cake. I be a little disappoint that it didn\\'t have a little more kick or apple flavor with the sour cream and apple chunks. I appreciate that it wasn\\'t overly sweet with ton of sugar. I use a 13x9 pan and it come out quite fluffy. Made for ZWT5 - Jammin Java Jivers Very delicious!  A wonderful cake with coffee that smell so fantastic while baking!  Gently flavour and not overpower - this be a definate make again winner!  Thanks to Leah, my Las Mistico Magico Sirenas Sistah!  Made for ZWT5. Wonderful cake, so moist and fluffy. Ummm. Really quick and easy to put together. I use low fat sour cream and no nut (we be not crazy about nut in food). Made for \\'went to the market\\' Made this cake for my other half to take to work & share, & although I haven\\'t hear back from them, I know IT\\'S A GREAT CAKE in every way! I cut it & put what piece I could in a slightly smaller, disposable aluminum carrier so have enough piece leave for several meal for the 2 of us! Really be a wonderful cake! I do increase the top by half & that work just fine! Thanks for a great keeper! [Tagged, make & review in Please Review My Recipe] Simply spectacular! I use walnuts, and take the advice of some other reviewer and increase the amount of top by 50%. I agree with others who note that the apple flavor be not prominent, but frankly the overall cake be so good that it didn\\'t matter to anyone in my house. :) I may increase the amount of chop apple slightly next time, and I will make sure to once again use very flavorful apple a a way of bring a much apple taste a possible to the cake. Other than that, I wouldn\\'t change a thing. I make this for a small party of 6 people, and have nothing but crumb leave at the end of the evening. It\\'s a winner, for sure. Thanks so much! My sweetie/eater says: light and fluffy cake, moist and fruity, with just the right amount of sweet crumble topping; not five star only because it wasn\\'t \"amazing\". Definitely would enjoy it again.\\n\\nI say: easy to make, tasty for not a lot of hassle and relatively healthy for a cake. I do have to increase the amount of topping. Next time I would increase the apple- the flavor of the cake be mostly the yummy topping, wasn\\'t really apple-ishus for me :) DELISH!!!  Used whole wheat flour, 1/2 Splenda and 1/2 sugar and Egg Beaters.  This be a moist, spongy cake.  YUM!  Even my dog think so -- He eat the last half of the cake off of the counter! My family really enjoy this cake (especially my dad who tend to be a bite picky).  I make the change suggest by some of the other reviewer (adding 50% more top and apples) and find this work really well.  The only thing I would change for next time be maybe use a different type of apple.  I use Jonah Gold and find that you couldn\\'t taste much of the apple so I may try use either Granny Smith or Fuji (one other thing that may have affect this be with the extra topping, it may have overpower the flavour of the apple so it might be worth try only 50% more apple and leave the measurement for the top the same).  Overall, I really enjoy this cake and love to see my family enjoy it so much. This be absolutely yummy.  I make this today to celebrate Mother&#039;s Day in advance.  All my family member love it.  I suggest to put twice the quantity of nut and apples.  It will taste even better.  I strongly recommend beginner cake- maker to attempt this cake cause it&#039;s easy to make and with no chance to fail.  Thanks so much for the wonderful recipe. Excellent recipe! I actually make in a bundt pan. Double the topping. Then spread 1/2 batter in pan, spread 1/2 the top on this.  Then pour remain batter ontop follow by the remain 1/2 of topping. This boost the flavour big time! This be the first time i try cake with sour cream.. &quot;the perfect cake ever&quot; come from my hubby dear. Thank you so much for the recipe..followed it exactly..am gonna prepare it often..the crunch from the topping and moistness of the cake if just Perfect ! This recipe be delicious! I do have to make a change a I didn\\'t have any nut so I make a streusel top instead... sooo gooood! Here\\'s the recipe for the alternate truth :P Streusel Ingredients: 1 cup all-purpose flour 1/4 cup pack light-brown sugar 1 teaspoon grind cinnamon 1/4 teaspoon salt 6 tablespoon unsalted butter, room temperature (approx. 100g) Directions: 1. In a medium bowl, combine flour, sugar, cinnamon, and salt. Using a pastry blender or fork, cut in the butter until fine crumb form. 2. Using hands, squeeze together most of the mixture to form clump (generally size of m&amp;m’s or pebbles). It really do live up to everyone\\'s review :) Absolutely delicious moist cake OMG!! I didnt have enough sour cream. I have 1/2 Cup of sour cream and for the other half I subsituted 1/2 cup of apple butter. Let me tell you!! The best, moist, not overly sweet apple cake I have ever eaten! The crunchy sweet top be the kicker to this cake. My mother in-law absolutely love this cake. That mean everything in my family! Hard to please woman! This be an excellent cake - perfectly moist and delicious, and the top take it to the next level. The reason for the 4 instead of 5 star be because I have to tweak it to get it just right, and bake it for about 10 minute longer. I increase the amount of apple and walnuts, and also add a bite more of the topping, and include nutmeg to the spice mix. Next time I will add some extra nut and even more apple into the cake batter itself. In the bundt pan, it make a beautiful presentation. Nice and easy to make. Going to be one of my favorite\\'s. Excellent - I get great compliment on this cake.',\n",
       " \" DH love this.  It be very very liquidy, so he eat it over rice.  The recipe didn't specify how to cut the onions, so I slice them.  Also, it didn't say where/when to add the mushrooms, so just put them in with everything else, it work fine.  I didn't use a dark beer, but will try one next time.\",\n",

I follow the recipe exactly and everyone  that have taste it love it too. Fabulous Grilling Sauce! Also great to baste on a free form meatloaf. My family doesnt like it scorch hot so we use some chilli sauce in place of jalapenos. Great BBQ sauce! Didn't have Jalapenos so I use Chipotle. Instead of mustard powder I grind up Black Mustard Seeds with my mortar and pestle. Used this on chicken that I start in a beer and chicken broth and pressure cooker (with the chicken above the broth in a rack... and finish in the broiler add the sauce in the last 5 minute of broiling. The name be a little mislead a this sauce do not taste like coffee.  However it be tasty and go great on tacos.  The cumin flavor be very powerful.

I use a light sorghum molasses, follow the recipe exactly.  I tend to be baking-impaired, so when I find a good recipe I clutch it to my bosom.  I serve this warm and top this with Darlene Summers\\' Lemon Sauce # 21838.  Truly a gastronomic experience.  My daughter and son-in-law be addicted.

I\\'ve never have gingerbread before and read several recipe on this site before decide on this one. It be really good and very easy to make. I halve the recipe for just the 2 of u and bake it in an 8x8 glass dish. I serve it with Cool Whip. I find it to be more moist the second day.

This be soft and moist.   I divide the batter into cupcake pan and it make about 15 cupcake and bake it for about 20-22 minute (rotating halfway through).  I also beat the batter for 3-4 minute until it thicken slightly after I add the eggs.  Thanks for sharing! Great cake. Very moist. My family oved it and we will make it again. Very good, and easy to make!  I double this, and make 9 mini loaf (3x5), which take around 20 min to bake.  Thanks Felix! Sorry.  Not impressed.  I make 2 big batch of it, anticipate a run on the stuff, (in light of the reviews), but it be dry, crumbly and surprisingly lack in spice.  Its main flavor seem to be molasses. Although I enjoy the taste of this recipe, I give it 3 star because a) you need to have more precise time on it - you can\\'t just say \"it\\'ll take more than 20 minutes\". and b) it be quite dense and dry a cake and I follow the recipe to a T. I add allspice and nutmeg to give a bite more flavour - I think it do it well. I\\'d like to start out by say WOW!!!  This turn out SO GOOD!  I bake often and I be thoroughly please with this outcome.  My family and I be about to decorate the Christmas tree and this will sure help get into the holiday spirit.  I add about a teaspoon of nutmeg, and the cake turn out fluffy and moist.  I will add this to \"favorites.\"  Thanks! This be a very good cake. I have to use spelnda for a diabetic but will eventually make a specified. I may have to up the star point when I do. It be moist. I love gingerbread. Not at all tasteless though I up the ginger and cinnamon for 1/2 recipe a tiny bit. I use 1 tsp ginger and 2 tsp cinnamon. If anyone say time be off or that it be dry it only show they do not know how to cook a all oven be different so time will be off for some people. Delicious! Light and moist. I love PKG\\'s idea of use this batter for cupcakes. I\\'ll be make this again. Thanks for posting! I also increase the ginger.  Try this warm with some lemon curd on top.  It\\'s delicious.  Wonderful recipe.  I know I\\'ll be use it again and again. WOW! This recipe be so delicious! Moist and just amaze with whip cream. Since I&#039;m the only one who like gingerbread, I make cup cake and freeze most of them for individual serve late on. Made for Sweet December tag. Nice moist and flavorful cake.  Made a double batch to serve at a party and it be a hit.  A nice presentation be to sift confectioner&#039;s sugar on top. Made a direct except I have to substitute butter for the shortening.

       " \" This make a great meal in hardly any time at all, and taste like something in a seafood restaurant.  The marinade and honey combo add lot of flavor. I must have buy the wrong kind of marinade. I use Newman's Own brand. Even try add more honey to make it sweeter.\",\n",
       " \" My kind of recipe. I've make it twice now and the first time I substitute grind almond for the coconut a the coconut I think I have disappear from the kitchen! So with no time to go to the local dairy and with a bite of desperation. I do the almond thing. This also work although I prefer the coconut. My experience with this recipe prove the validity of the admonition to use correct, high-quality ingredients. So don't use brown basmati, almond instead of coconut, and under ripe avocados.  Certainly not a fair trial of this recipe. Im usually very open to recipe and give them the a re-evaluation on my pallet have I subistituted some ingredient for others, however....I follow everthing to the dot and this recipe just taste weird. There be just something miss I do not feel like the ingredient mix well with one another. Hi Roxanne!<br/>This be good. Fast and easy, make a great quick lunch, with leftover to go with something for dinner. I do toss in some cook black bean for fiber, add a tablespoon of soaked, finely chop almond to kick up the protein a notch, and I use a very small amount of garlic chili paste. I can see this become a staple when I have to find something yummy to do with my ripe avocados. This be not the recipe to use when you want to blow away the guest at an engagement party, but I give it four star because it be delicious, nutritious, and super practical.\",\n",

       " \" With the year round availability of strawberry decide to try this a a delicious treat in the midst of January's chill.  To make this dish consistent with WW Core, I use a combination of fat free mayo and sour cream in lieu of the regular stuff.  Really like the lemon in the dress a it be perfectly tart without be sour.  Did find the amount of sugar be too much and sort of overpower the nice combination of lemon in the dressing, the tarragon on the chicken and the strawberries. Since this be truly a to taste issue, suggest start with a little bite le than the state amount and add the rest to taste.  Also dress be a bite thick (my mix do emulate the consistency of the real stuff) and add a little milk to make it easy to dress he salad. Thanks! This be just lovely!  I also use non-fat mayo and Splenda in place of the sugar.  I add extra lemon juice because I like it, and make the dress go farther...because my salad be HUGE.  Lots of greens, add dice cucumber and sugar snap peas, and I use turkey breast meat instead of chicken.  This be a wonderful main dish salad that I will make again and again! Even tho I forget the almonds, this be so good.  Used 1 breast for the two of u and all spinach.  Loved the dressing.  Will make this one always.\",\n",

A little on the spicy side if you use all of the cayenne, so if you want it milder, i would use either 1/8 tsp or maybe just a little extra grind black pepper.  But either way, it be a big hit! This be a nice side dish for our fish dinner.  The only problem be in the cook time - it need all of 20 minute to complete and also have to add more liquid.

I marinate it for 25 hour and be a bite worry we would only taste it (the marinade), but it be remarkably subtle (and VERY flavourful). We eat this over rice with an Asian style salad on the side. Yummmm. I want to make this and keep forget to marinate the tenderloin so I take the recipe and tweak the end result.  Smaller piece don\\'t need to marinate quite so long!  I cut the pork tenderloin into 1 inch chunk and marinate them for approximately 20 minutes.  Quickly saute them in the pan (in two batches) until they be cook through and serve it over jasmine rice with a peanut sauce drizzle over it all.  Excellent! Wow! This be so easy and delicious. I didn&#039;t have time to marinate a long a direct so simply cut a few slit into the pound out meat, marinate about 30 minute and grill a directed. It turn out perfect; juicy and melt in your mouth tender! Making this one for dad on Father&#039;s Day.',\n",
       " \" This be so easy to throw together...I make it just for myself and use the hot pepper sauce...I just wrap all the ingredient in some aluminum foil and toss the packet on the grill with my chicken and let it do it's thing...I cook it for about 10 minute and the cabbage be cook with a nice crunch to it..\",\n",

Really tasty, I use lamb leg steak which work fine, they be tender and taste delicious.\\r\\nGreat recipe, thank for sharing. Use this recipe for leg of lamb but I find that it be good to boil down the balsamic - it adhere good and have more flavour.  Can be marinate overnight.  Thanks for submit because very few recipe here have balsamic in their marinade. Yum! I make this exactly a direct except that I marinate them for about 1 hour. Easy and delicious.

Flavors be great.  This recipe be very special.  I take bluemoon\\'s suggestion and add a bite of garlic to the marinade.  Looking forward to more special occasion :) I make these for hubby and Little Miss (DD) and they both enjoy them.  Hubby say lamb be even more tender then usual and the flavour be really great.  I use white balsamic vinegar and marinate them for about 4 hours.  I didn\\'t get to sample the lamb (I only eat seafood and poultry) but hubby and Little Miss enjoy the lamb.  Thank you I\\'mPat for a easy recipe. A lovely simple dish to make & full of flavour. Hubby say I should do lamb chop like that more often. I use chump chop and just cut off any extra fat before cooking. Thanks Pat! Delicious a usual with your recipe Pat.  Never a disappointment.  This go well with mash potato and oven roast cauliflower.  Made for NZ/AUS Make My Recipe Edition 9 Very easy- very tasty. I add splash of garlic powder and let marinade for 90 mins. Yummy! I use a rack of lamb chop a I couldn\\'t find traditional loin lamb chop in any of the markets, so when I saw the rack I be happy! I marinate the rack for about 15 minute and grill them on our new grill. Made for Potluck tag, Summer 2010. Fantastic marinate! I go to two different supper market yesterday and could not get lamb and at the second one could not even get pork chop a it be late I end up settle for a pork stake and figure if it do not turn out I would just wait and review this recipe in a week or two when I could get lamb chops. Well guess what this marinate supper well on my pork steak and be Sooo Yummy. This recipe be a true keeper that I be already look forward to use again, thank for the post. This be our first time try lamb. We want to keep it simple so we could taste the flavor of the lamb. The chop be fantastic!! We fry them in a pan for about 5 minute per side. The balsamic and rosemary really complement the meat without overwhelm it. Wonderful marinade!&lt;br/&gt;So easy and simple to do, and the family love the extra flavour on their lamb.&lt;br/&gt;Thanks Pat, will be make this again for sure.',\n",
       " ' What a great cookie recipe. These come out sweet and malty in taste with a soft interior and crackly top. I love them and so do the guest at a friend bday party.

       " ' This be pretty good. The problem I have be the amount of spice be TOO much. The combo be flavorful, but it really, really coat the zucchini and the pan. Next time, I\\'ll halve the spices. I pile on a plate, sprinkle with some low-fat cheddar & a bite of cook bacon, and dip in some ranch dress -- a la \"Loaded Fries\" ;) -- instead of the chili sauce. Thanks for the recipe. Following newspapergal\\'s suggestion, I decrease the season for these fry to just a sprinkle of grill seasoning.  (I use McCormick\\'s Montreal Seasoning.)  These be a simple side for an easy night of chili dogs.  We use ranch dress a a dipper intead of the chili or taco sauce. I though these be good, but I don\\'t think I would make them again. Maybe decrease the season and use ranch for dip like the other reviewer say would have make them better.  This be a Rachel Ray recipe, although it doesn\\'t say it anywhere on this page.  Just think I\\'d let everyone know the source.  I remember her make it on the show and I check at the Foodnetwork website and saw the recipe there. These be alright. I use olive oil instead of spray, chilli powder, cumin salt and pepper. They come out a bite soggy, next time I\\'ll cut them thick and cook them for a short period of time. Maybe can be improve with the help of breadcrumbs?  I make these to go along with a Mexican theme meal and the entire meal be disastrous! I end up throw everything out. These be really soggy, even after stick them under the broiler for 10 minutes. And there be definitely way too much seasoning. I even try dip them in various sauce and dressings. I won\\'t be make these again.',\n",
       " \" These be quite nice, very tasty. The only change I make be to use a multi-grain baguette and to sub basil paste because I couldn't find fresh basil. I also spread half of them onto a bake sheet and warm them at 400°F for 3 minute to melt the cheese on top. They be great both hot and at room temperature. I make this for a bridal shower and have intend to heat them a note in the other comment.  I have guest eat them off the bake sheet before I could get them to the oven.  I run out of the pesto mixture and have to use bottle tomato pesto to finish up.  The recipe pesto be far superior.\",\n",

A simple side to put together, I like the dress a lot the only change I make to it be to add about 1/2 the amount of celery seed.  For the salad I have to leave out the pimento because I couldn\\'t find any, and sub arugula for watercress.  Made 1/2 the recipe and it be the perfect amount a a side for 3 of us.  Made during ZWT7. OhMyGoodness, this be very \"puckery.\" So different from my normal KFC-like slaw! The green olive add a briny flavor, and we didn\\'t think it be sweet enough, so I add more sugar and a little more oil. I use red wine vinegar. It wasn\\'t bad, just different from what we\\'re use to! ZWT7 - Shady Ladies I love vinegar so this be perfect for me. I didn\\'t have any watercress so I put in about a 1/2 cup of chop cilantro. I think more green olive would be nice too. All in all, a great slaw! Thanks for sharing. Made for ZWT7-Pacific Islands.',\n",

My son be also allergic to dairy products, so I use a dairy-free margarine, and chocolate chip that be \"allergen free.\"  I think that the consistency/texture of the cookie would suffer because of the margarine and lack of a real egg, but it really be just like a Toll House cookie!  I use a medium cookie scoop (looks like an old fashion ice cream scoop with a spring--you can get them at place like Linens and Things or through Pampered Chef) and I have find that this help create that chewy center.  The scoop also give each cookie that nice round shape.  It\\'s so nice to finally have a chocolate chip cookie that the whole family can enjoy! We love this recipe!!!!  I have be search for a great chocolate chip cookie recipe, and I finally find it!  Tastes like the real toll house cookies.  If you like them chocolaty, use more chips.  Thank you so much for this!

This recipe be fantastic!  It have just the right combination of egg replacer and water create a perfect cookie texture!  I even find let the dough rest a few minute give the cooky a good rise.  Thanks for share this recipe.  This be my son\\'s first chocolate chip cookie! Have to agree with other reviewer that it taste just like a tollhouse cookie--you can&#039;t even tell the egg be in there. I halve the recipe and use white whole wheat flour instead of all-purpose.

You can appreciate the texture good after they totally cool. The top of the cooky look slightly \"biscuit-like\" even though I use a cookie scoop and flatten the tops.

I think I\\'ll try add more sugar next time. Very good cookies, soft and a good density. I make 1/3 recipe for the frost and it be plenty. We decorate these for Christmas. Thanks! Really easy to follow instructions.  It be a very good cookie.  I didn&#039;t feel like make ice so I use chocolate chip instead.  My husband love them.

U will luv it. It really be a perfect combo. This be always my favorite frost grow up- a special treat that I require on every birthday.

I just make a white or yellow cake, drizzle some sweeten condense milk on top of each layer and frost with this special frosting.  Sometimes I will top it off with coconut.  Yummmm! This be wonderful. When I be little, my mom always make me angel food cake with this frosting, and ballerina on the top! It HAD to be pink! I add a teaspoon of espresso powder to the water and it give a mild coffee flavor to the finish frost and I also put it on angel food cake. Great for any occasion!

These be really good right out of the oven, but I find that I like them just a much cold out of the fridge the next day. Definitely a keeper for us, thank for posting! Made for PAC Fall 2011\",\n",
       " \" Oh my, these be amazing! I have on a burger and put the rest in the fridge for late in the week. However, they call me with a siren song and I just have to go back and eat more. The best caramelize onion EVER. I make this tonight to go with fry pork chops.  It be delicious.  I have make carmelized onion before, but never think to add sherry.  It add a nice subtle flavor to the onions.  I do not add the rosemary and thyme, but plan to do so the next time I make this, which will be soon.  Very easy recipe to prepare while cook the main dish.  Thanks for the great idea!! Delicious! We devour them, definately will be make again.  Thanks! Oh these be Good!I use a sweet onion and otherwise follow the directions. I don't know what I be think but I halve the recipe. BIG Mistake. I almost finish the onion before they leave the pan. You'll love these! I love caramelize onion so much and this be such a special way to do them.  Very rich and full flavored. Thanks for sharing!  Made ZWT3 Delicious version of caramelise onions. I use sprinkle of dry thyme and rosemary because it be too dark, cold and windy to venture into the garden to find the fresh. In Australia, we say brown, rather than yellow, onions. Made and enjoy for Zaar World Tour. Delicious! We love caramelize onion and the herb and sherry be nice additions. I make extra to be able to have some in the freezer. Thanks Rita. Yummy!!  Yummy!! Yummy!!! I serve this on Saturday night, with burgers!  Made them into a gourmet meal!! YUM!  Rita, I love these caramelize onions.  The sherry really make the dish.  I use fresh thyme and rosemary from my garden and follow your recipe to a 'T'.  Everything just marry together.  I will definitely add these to my rotation.  Made and devour for ZWT5, for Hell's Kitchen Angels.\",\n",
       " \" I stumble upon this recipe a I be brew a pot of coffee tonight, so I think I'd try it out!  I add 3/4 tsp. of instant coffee granule to the warm coffee, a my brew coffee wasn't very strong.  The batter be whip up in no time, and the coffee square be bake in only 25 minutes. The texture seem similar to cake brownies, and I enjoy a nice warm slice with a cup of coffee!  (Yes, coffee cake and hot coffee - I'll probably be awake all night!!!)  easy to make, nice flavor, different from all the other cake and brownie I usually make.  I make a mistake and add too much coffee, then have to increase the flour and add another egg to get the right consistency- they still turn out well after 30 minute baking. At first, I have to admit, I be a bite worry because the batter seem quite thin. I think maybe it be because I add the coffee and vanilla in with the butter/sugar mixture since the recipe didn't really specify, but they come out beautifully! SOOO light and tender and absolutely delicious! I be suprised how the chocolate chip sink into the squares, but I think that it make them even good with the chip inside. The cake didn't have a very strong coffee flavor, but this be still a Great recipe! Mine turn out more like brownie than cake but judge from the other photo maybe that be my fault. Aside from that, I be very disappoint with the taste. The extreme sweetness of the brown sugar and chocolate chip totally dominate and none of u could taste any coffee flavor.  I use a really strong coffee on purpose for the flavor and be disappoint when it didn't come through at all. If I make them again I'd cut the sugar back to 1 cup and omit the chocolate chips. Even though I use mini chocolate chips, most of them sink to the bottom and make the bar hard to remove from the pan. Sorry, but they be not our favorite at all. very easy to do. But it almost tasteless.i wouldnt recommend this Found this recipe while look for recipe that use coffee.  My ex leave a whole cannister in my fridge and I'm not a big coffee drinker.  I think some of the other reviewer that didn't like this recipe be expect a cake that taste exactly like a bitter cup of coffee.  Yuk.  I'm GLAD these don't have that strong of a flavor!  I've see this type of complaint in cola recipe a well.  Beverages just don't take over the flavor when use in baking.  This cake be moist, but not explode with coffee taste.\\r\\nI actually use a full cup of chocolate chip and despite my love of chocolate it seem a bite much.  I'll definitely keep to the recipe and only use 1/2 a cup next time.  Very yummy, sweet and so simple to make.  Thnaks!  simple, easy, and quite nice =)\\n\\ni like how the crust be a bite crispy on the outside and than sorta like a cake-like texture on the inside..best when it's warm :) My whole family love these! I will definitely make them again, just a directed. I want to use Starbucks Coffee Liqueur instead of coffee so I do and it have a great flavor but it be pretty strong. I think next time I will use 1/4 cup coffee and 1/4 cup of the liqueur. I will be make these again though, especially for company they be a great after dinner snack. This be a nice deviation from the normal coffee cake I usually make.  I really like this a lot! Really nice recipe. Easy and quick, cake texture with a nice mellow coffee flavor. The crust crisp up nicely and the choc chip didn't sink at all, just melt over the top. Yes it very sweet but I don't have a problem with that. Great with a coffee or warm a a desert with some ice cream on the side. Many thank !\",\n",
       " '  I apologize Marie Alice I make two mistake - I cover the turnip  to speed the cooking-the result be over cooked, very soft almost mushy turnip. You say use a LARGE pan I use a small one and the turnip be at least 4 deep. If I be rat this recipe the way I botch it it would be a 2 star, however the cook be at fault here not the recipe. I will make the recipe accord to instruction and re  write this review Sorry Marie Alice but perhaps this review will serve a a warn others to follow the instructions. This be easy and delicious!  I use rutabaga, enough for two good servings.  Put it through the food processor a suggested, it cook up in about 20 minutes, and I just go back to it several time to keep it stirred.  Bergy\\'s experience with this recipe be helpful, thank for that post too.  I make this use just one large rutabaga and my husband and I be also hooked.  I do use my food processor for the grating, which make it not only fast but much easy a well.  The flavor be fantastic...kind of sweet with cabbage and turnip undertones.  My saute time be about 15-20 minute and I use sea salt and freshly grate black pepper.  Great recipe for this neglected, but delicious, vegetable!  Thanks MarieAlice :) My DH and I both love rutabegas!!  We eat them quite often! I have to say...just that little bite of brown sugar...these be fantastic! Thank you! I have to admit that I love turnip do this way....but I hate the peel of the darn things! So I cheat...I buy freeze turnip.  I know it might not be the same but this save so much time. And the end result be terrific.  The brown sugar and creamy butter add exactly what the turnip be missing....personality! This be the only way I have be serve turnip for years....and wouldn\\'t change a thing! Thanks for post this MarieAlice....it\\'s a lovely recipe! Second time I have make this...EXCELLENT..served with Hamburgers/Brown Gravy (32973) and Buttered Egg Noodles (11107), beef be home trim and grind once from a piece of bottom round, the hard part be grate the rutabaga....gave me something to do while the burger cooked.  The processor be too noisy and beat it\\'s material to a pulp These be marvelous and buttery and very autumnal - but they do take a long time to cook and they do require a LARGE pan. WOW!!  My toddler actually said, \"I love rutabaga.\"  Well, actually it be \"rude-buggah\" but I\\'m pretty sure she mean dinner.  :)  I use a mandolin slicer and it come out well.  It didn\\'t take too long to prepare.  I put some chicken in the oven and then peeled, cut and start cook the rutabaga, then put on some convert rice and everything finish all together. Thanks, Marie Alice!! This be really wonderful. I make it about a year ago and forget to review it. I be glad I find it again. Love love love this! I use 1 small rutabega. The only way my family ever eat rutabega be mash on Thanksgiving. But THIS be how I\\'ll be make mine on holiday from now on. Simple and delicious! What more can I say, it be perfect for our weekday night meal :) With the food processer, prep take about 5 min. I love this! I have never cook rutabaga and I have only eat it a a part of roast root vegetables.  My large rutabaga give me 5 shred cups, and I cook it in 3 tablespoon butter. I season lightly with salt and pepper, and I use maple flakes--crystallized maple syrup--in place of the brown sugar. My father give me 2 turnip that be give to him.  I choose this recipe to make a a side when he come over for dinner.  When I ask him if he want any, he say \"Just a little. I don\\'t like cook turnips.\"  When he finally get around it eat it, he say \"that be really good!\"  Unfortunately, there be none leave for him to have seconds.  Everyone else gobble them down.  BTW:  I use my food processor to shred (not chop) and it work beautifully. I adore this and DH like it too. I do add some chop onion, like a few others do, which I cut pretty small in the blender because grate it doesn\\'t work very well. I think I use extra butter and have replace it with olive oil before which be good a well. This be the first rutabaga recipe I\\'ve try and I fell in love. Definitely will make this again. Wow!  This be SOOO good!  What a nice change from \\'boring old yellow turnips\\'.  Added some onions, too. Will definitely make again.  Thanks for sharing!<br/><br/>**Just make it again - fry up some slab bacon & throw it in.....  to die for - literally! My husband and I like this a bunch!  I have 3 small purple-topped turnip and didn\\'t know what to do with them - this be easy and very tasty, even though I cut back a bite on the butter.  Now I plan to add more turnip (and rutabegas!) to our meal.',\n",

       " ' Review My Recipe 2008 ~ This be de-lish!!  I halve the recipe a there be only the two of us.  I be go to have the leftover for lunch today, but the Midnight Fridge Raider (aka DH) eat what be left! I\\'ll just have to make some more!  Thanks LisG. UPDATE 3/8/08 ~ make again but sub sweet potato for the squash and cheddar for the gruyere.    Slight change in taste but be still great! My first review have be zap into the fourth dimension!  So here go again.  I love all the key ingredient in this recipe so my expectation of love it be indeed high.  I felt, however, that (to meet our taste preferences) it would benefit from a couple of addition which would add far variation to the flavour and texture.  I add 3 Granny Smith apple (peeled and slice to the same thickness a the potatoes), 1/2 a cup of chop pecans, a flat teaspoon of brown sugar (just the teeny amount) and sprinkle of cinnamon.  I add some of each of these between each layer.  As I\\'m usually one who who considerably reduce or omit sugar in recipes, it be with some ambivalence that I add it here, but it seem such a natural pair with the apple and cinnamon.  The end result: absolutely fabulous.  We thoroughly enjoy this dish and would happily eat it a a vegetarian main course dish so I will certainly be make it again - often.  And next time, for variation, I\\'m go to use walnuts.  I\\'m also go to sneak in a liitle wine, perhaps by add 1/2 a tablespoon to the leek while they\\'re cooking.  For the moment, however, I\\'m happy that we have several additional serve in the freezer!  Thank you so much for share this truly wonderful recipe, LifeIsGood! I concur wholeheartedly with the previous 5-star reviews!  I love leek (which go great with potatoes) but I really be indifferent to butternut squash.  Well, not anymore!  These three ingredient marry so well!  I will be serve this on my Easter dinner table this year.  It be a great holiday presentation and be truly delicious!  Made for Please Review My Recipe Tag Game. Quite the process to put together but it taste great.   The only change be I use salt butter & brick cheese instead.  We be start to enjoy scallop potato with a chicken broth base (vs milk) so I\\'d like to try this one with that variation.  Really enjoy the leek & squash in the recipe, thank for sharing. Like LifeIsGood, I love, love, love this recipe! I make some modification (and I\\'ll do them again so a not to risk a different result â€” it be that good!) First, like another reviewer suggested, I use vegetable broth in place of the whole milk. Very happy with the creamy sauce that resulted. I also use Earth Balance margarine in place of butter. (I do use Gruyere cheese, but I can imagine leave it out or use vegan cheese to make this a great dish for vegans.) I also didn\\'t have quite enough leeks, so I add a half of an onion. I think I have enough potatoes, but didn\\'t so I use sweet potatoes. I know it sound like a lot of changes, but the spirit of the recipe be still there and I absolutely LOVED it. Also, it take about 20 extra minute to cook. But it\\'s easy to test with a fork to make sure it\\'s really tender. I think my version be a little low calorie, and because it will serve more than the 6 indicate on the nutrition info, I don\\'t even feel guilty about enjoy this wonderful dish. I\\'m put this in my \"good enough for company\" book right now. Thanks for posting!! My, my, my!  This be so delicious! Another win recipe from LIG!!!  I love scallop potates and butternut squash so I know this would be wonderful!!  I send DH to the grocery store to pick up a butternut squash and he come home with a buttercup squash!  Well, no time to go back to the store so decide to make do with what I had!  Otherwise make this recipe a is.  What a wondeful and beautiful potato dish!  I will be make this again very soon!  Thank you GF!!  Made for KK Chef\\'s Pick OMG this be surprisingly great Rich and luxurious! I use all squash and lactose-free whole milk. I be concern about the LF milk because it be much sweet than traditional milk, but it work perfectly. I split it into two pan and freeze one.',\n",

       " ' Great frittata Lennie!  I use two large egg with one egg white. As Country lady did, I also through in some hash brown and that work out well, great mix of veggie here, I really enjoy this with a small salad. Thanks for sharing!...Kittencal:) I double this for the two of us, it be quite delicious!  I use up bit and piece from the fridge, onion, chives, jalepeno, broccoli, green pepper, mushrooms, tomato,diced and sliced, ham, parsley and cheddar and dry basil. It turn out a nice combination, this will be a good one to clean out the fridge.\\r\\nThanks for sharing! A tasty weekend breakfast dish - and so much healthy than those fat load sausage or bacon! I use fresh from the garden chive instead of green onions, mozarella cheese & throw in a handful of Cavendish Farms freeze hash browns.\\r\\nSince I double the recipe & I be concern about overflowing, I place the veggie into a deep dish pie, pour the egg over top, then add the cheese & a liberal shake of lemon pepper. I probably won\\'t use zucchini next time a I find it too squishy. Thanx Lennie! Great taste easy dish. I also double the recipe. I use tomatoes, onions, mushroom and cheddar cheese. I will certainly be make this again. Thanks Lennie. Easy to make. I use 4 eggs, zucchini, tomato, mushrooms, spring onions,red pepper, green pepper, and mince garlic, chop parsley, salt & lot of freshly grind black pepper and grate parmesan cheese.\\r\\nYum!! Thanks for post such a versatile recipe:) Good stuff. I make this a few week ago and several time since and each time it have be amazing. It\\'s so easy and very versatile. It work well with just about any vegetables. The first time I make two separate frittata - one for myself and the other with a about 1/2 a teaspoon of chilli flake and a bite of extra salt and pepper for my fiance. He love it and have since make a couple for himself a a quick lunch. I\\'ve also try it with chop chicken breast, but I don\\'t think I like it a much a with just plain vegetables. I think it would be very good with a small amount of bacon or ham throw in, which I plan to try soon. Thank you Lennie for this wonderful recipe. Woo-Hoo! You have achieve egg perfection (perfEGGtion, perhaps?)! Although I change all the veggies, I\\'m give you 5 star for the method, the ease of preparation, and the fact that you save me from have to be a kitchen mathematician! Yes, Lennie. Perfection. This frittata be one terrific dish. I use mushrooms, green onions, zucchini, tomato, asparagus and green beans.  I use mozzarella cheese a I have a bite leave over but cheddar would be great a well. I forget the basil so I can imagine how much good that would have make it.  I\\'m always look for different thing to make for lunch and this one certainly fill the bill. Great recipe. Easy and adaptable. Made it for two people add an extra egg [5 total]  Left out the cheese and potato, add celery  and use portabello mushroom , green pepper and  2 clove fresh garlic .   wonderful brunch idea! i make it for myself, but be quite a bite for one serving, and end up share it with my mom and dad, who both really like it. my mom ask me to make it again for the whole family. the fresh tomato really give it a great touch. i will be make this one many time     %   EXCELLENT meal!! Even my 2 toddler eat it. I watch amaze a they gobble up zucchini, tomato and mushrooms! I think it be delicious and will most definately be make again! I make this for breakfast this morning.  DH and I be just start on a diet.  We\\'re not go fanatic on it, but just try to make sure what we put in our mouth be healthy.  I use olive oil instead of butter, and use broccoli instead of zucchini, and add some chop green pepper, slice carrot, and shallots.  I add a little skim milk to the beat eggs, a few slice of swiss cheese in addition to the cheddar, and sprinkle some nutmeg on the top.  It be great - DH said, \"That\\'s actually sort of good.\"  Believe me, that\\'s a compliment! This be now one of my favorite quick and easy meals, which I make often.  I usually make it with zucchini, yellow squash, and tomatoes.  I leave out the potato and green onions.  Even my husband love this light meal and we think it taste great with toast whole wheat english muffins. This be a great brunch dish or when u have guest visiting. Just throw it all together and bake and spend the rest of the time with your guests. Tastes great, i do add some shred parmagiano reggiano. I just love egg and experiment with every kind of veggie or meat combo. When the recipe call for potato though I tend to reach for the ever handy bag of hash brown in the freezer and they work a well with a dollop of cream. As Lennie point out you can use any veggie or cheese and it come out sensationally. H doesnt like a heavy lunch so I tend to do 2 omelette a sandwich and 2 soup in a week. This be the best recipe to play with for variety. This Baked Frittata for One be great. I actually triple it to make it for 3 people, everyone love it. I will make this again for sure. I serve for dinner with garlic bread (cheese and bacon). Thanks for sharing! Not sure if I should rate this a I change a LOT of it, but it be a frittata for one (me for my lunch).  I use everything from my garden (apart from the 3 egg & cheese) - zucchini flowers, chives, fresh thyme and basil.  I mix everything but the cheese and cook in a small saute pan with butter and olive oil for 4 minutes, then sprinkle Emmenthal cheese on top and put the pan under the grill for a far 3 minute to cook the top.  It be brill, although next time I\\'ll saute some zucchini flesh and perhaps some onion too.  Leftover cook potato would be really good and some tomato a soon a ours ripen in the greenhouse. Quick and easy but kind of bland for us.  I have to cut back on the mushroom because 6 would have be all we taste if we have use them all.  Thanks for sharing! Delicious and flexible recipe -- I use lot of zucchini, green and white onions, garlic and fresh dill, since that\\'s what be in the fridge this week. But I can imagine lot of good veggie combinations, depend on whats available. Made this for breakfast today and it be awesome!  I use what I have handy - some coppa, tomatoes, mushrooms, parsley, green onions, chevre and five egg - be make this for more than one person!  It be all go pretty quickly. This make a really quick and delicious lunch for u today.  I use leftover veggies....asparagus, mushrooms, chop baby potato (boiled & sauteed), cheddar cheese and season with chives, basil, salt, pepper and garlic powder.  I make this for two so I use 5 egg and it be perfectly size for a standard pie tin.  I hate throw away small amount of cook vegetable so this be a great recipe to use them up for lunch the next day.  I\\'ll definitely be make this again, especially a soon a my chick grow up and start give me fresh eggs!  Thanks for the recipe Lennie :) Loved it!  Used all veggie from the garden include kale, eggplant, beans, onion, carrot, and tomato. I also increase to 3 egg since it look like it need it. Used parsley from the garden too!  It&#039;s best to use a strong cheese, I think. Will definitely make again, and thank for posting. This be a great recipe on the basic make of a frittata! I have never make one before, so this recipe be perfect on teach me the basics! The first time I use this, I use a pie plate, but the second time I use a little round cake pan, and it come out just a great! DON&#039;T forget to grease a pie plate WELL if you&#039;re use one. This recipe be so perfect, it&#039;s the same bake time pretty much for however many egg you add! Thanks for teach me to finally bake one of these things! No more basic omelet for this gal! This be a wonderful start. I never have make a fritatta before. The first time I make it in a regular pie plate but it come out too thin. So I go on Amazon and find mini pie plat that end up make the perfect size. This morning I use two large egg with a couple of teaspoon of milk mix in: a little grind sea salt and pepper into the eggs. I saute in butter, a few slice mushrooms, a little red onion and green onions, a leftover cook sausage patty crumble and a few cook leftover dice potato a that be what I had. Next time, I will use more veggie like dice tomato and spinach or kale. As a reminder, don\\'t forget to grease your bake dish. I use coconut oil spray.',\n",

My mom be nice enough to do all of the prep work (making the meatball and sauces). Since it be my birthday, I get to assemble. We cheat and use prepare pie crust (3 of the kind that come roll up and refrigerated). We use a very large metal mix bowl to bake the thing. Ours turn out quite a bite flat but still delicious! We actually bake it for a little over 2 hours, and it be perfectly done. It be a lot of work but fun to do a a group. A must do at least once in a lifetime! This be a really fun recipe. I use jar pasta meat sauce and make my own meatballs. I use way more cheese and also add mozzarella to the layers. I also use Italian bread crumbs. I bake this just a lil over 2 hour and let it sit upside down on the platter with the bowl on for a half hour. I remove the bowl and let it sit for another 15 minuste. PERFECT and still hot. I never have a problem with it fall apart. Letting it rest be the most important step.\\r\\n\\r\\nEdited to add, I use lot more sauce.. I wanna say over 3 cups. Next time, I\\'ll ue even more. That will work if I make a wee thick crust.',\n",

It be also a bite on the soupy side, but that may have be because I didn't drain the bean (I wasn't sure from the direction whether I should or not). All in all, an excellent addition to my cook repertoire. Im not sure what I do wrong, I REALLY want this to work. After the 20 min on MED all my rice be burn to a crisp! I wonder if my wattage be off, but my microwave be really old and not too strong so I dont know. I drain my bean maybe that be it? Oh well! I love this rice!  The cinnamon add a really interest flavor and a natural sweetness. I didn't add any sugar and my daughter still think it be a bite too sweet.

I add a few more garlic cloves, some shake of dry oregano and basil, and some fresh parsley. I also sub turkey pepperoni for the proscuitto, mainly because it's cheaper, and this work fine. The red (meat), white (pasta and cheese and sauce), and green (spinach and parsley) be very pretty together. BTW, it may be obvious, but I do my stir in my noodle-boiling pot, and then pour this into my casserole pan. Otherwise I'd have have most of it on the counter! I bake it cover for all but about 7 minute of the cook time, and since I have REALLY drain my spinach, this turn out fine with respect to the moisture level. It go over well with everyone here, and we'll definitely have it again. This be good. I use penne and follow the recipe, except I only use half of the spinach. Very easy to make. I think it be really good, but DH wouldn't eat it. (b/c of the spinach??) DD pick out the noodles. If I didn't reduce the pasta amount this would definately have be to dry, I only use 1/2 pound of pasta which be just fine, I use 1 cup whip cream with 1 cup half and half, also add in some cayenne pepper and 1/2 cup Parmesan cheese into the cream mixture, thank for share hon!...Kitten:) Delicious.  And since I LOVE spinach, certainly a recipe I'll happily make again. I increase the garlic to three clove and add one onion - both of which I minced.  Having several time be surprise - and most disappoint - that onion have not fully cook in a dish bake in the oven, I saute the onion and garlic until just softened.  I then add the other ingredient in step four to the pan, and add a pinch of nutmeg while season with salt and freshly grind black pepper.  Only then do I transfer the ingredient to the bake dish.  I follow KITTENCAL's recommendation and halve the pasta.  Inspired by dicentra's photographs, I use penne.  I add 2 handful of chop baby spinach leave (which I always have a plentiful supply of on hand) to the 2 packet of freeze (thoroughly squeezed) spinach.  I use low-fat milk and low-fat ricotta (as specified) and add a tablespoon of Greek yoghurt.  I also add about 1/2 cup of pine-nuts, an obvious addition in a recipe with spinach and ricotta! Thanks for share this delicious recipe, Redsie.  We all thoroughly enjoy this dish.  Made for 1-2-3 Hit Wonders 2008. What's not to like?  I have prosciutto and ricotta that I need to use.  Found this recipe and be glad I did.  The recipe be reduce to 4 servings.  I love have the ability to adjust serve sizes.  I use gluten free brown rice spiral for the pasta.  The prosciutto be crisp before add to the casserole.  A touch of nutmeg be added.  This be serve with a side salad for a wonderful meal.  Thanks for posting.\",\n",
       " \" Really good. Just like Dutch speculaas apple cake. Made mine with GF flour with some almond powder for Christmas and it be demolish by my daughter. Had some problem get it out of the bake tin though! This be an excellent cake! The apple flavour come through so well, and it's extremely moist. I leave out the raisins, and use about 1/2 cup of chop walnuts. I also decrease the oil to 1/3 cup. Made it for a friend who's daughter have an egg & dairy allergy. They love it! Since the previous reviewer have trouble get the cake out of the pan, I line my 13x9 with wax paper. The cake come out perfectly! Thanks for post the recipe. I'll be use it again, and again. This be a drop-dead-easy recipe to follow for a knock-your-socks-off tasty cake. Since our apple have be in a vegetable drawer in the fridge for three month and the raisin be a bite dry, I add about 1/3 cup water to the batter to help hydrate the fruit. And I may have use an extra 2/3 cup of apple slices. Can&#039;t help add extra fruit. All who eat the cake with a dollop of whip top love it.\",\n",

I have plenty of leftover to bring in to work the next and the smell have people from all over the build ask where the aroma be come from.

       " \" I happen upon this recipe today and decide since I have all the ingredient on hand, I would try it.  I don't usually have soup this time of year too much but the recipe appeal to me. I'm glad I did.  I really enjoy this for dinner tonight.  Very easy to do.  I make it while run back and forth watch the Portugal/Holland Soccer game.  I follow the direction except I add garlic and a little basil. And I like that it be good for phase 1 of the SB Diet.  I have do that diet and it be wonderful.  Thanks, Tara for a great recipe and Good Luck on your diet. This recipe be so easy to make, and it taste great, especially the next day when the flavor have really blended.  Next time I'll use a little more broth, to make it more soupy - but it's fine just a it is. Easy to fix, great taste with good flavor.  Very easy and comfort soup.  I saute my onion with the grind beef and add garlic, also.  My tomato be petite dice with garlic and olive oil.  (I don't like big chunk of stew tomato.)  I add a second can of beef broth, a there just didn't seem to be enough liquid, and adjust the season amount in accordance with the add liquid.  I also add about 1/2 cup of tomato juice to enhance the flavor.  There weren't any red kidney bean in my pantry...so I use white beans.  Hubby have 2 bowl of this soup with some crusty multi-grain dinner rolls.  I plan on take the leftover for my lunch.  This be a simple, but tasty soup. This be very easy and inexpensive since I be look to use up these ingredients. I find it a little bland - but I think that the ingredient make my thought turn to chili .... \\r\\n\\r\\nI add garlic salt and some cayene pepper and that brighten it right up. \\r\\n\\r\\nAdditionally ( since it make a lot ) I add some freeze mix veggie on day 3 and morph it into vegetable soup - very good a well. \\r\\n\\r\\nAn excellent soup and a really good base for a lot of other things, minestrone, veggie, chili etc. \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for a great recipe.  Excellent recipe! This be a soup that look and taste like you've spend all day prepare it. The only change that I make be to add a can of black eye pea instead of the kidney beans. Thanks for sharing! This be a very easy recipe to make.  I always follow recipe exactly a written, and do so with this one a well, but find it a bite bland for our taste and add extra pepper and some salt.  Being cabbage lovers, I put in more than the recipe call for and I also have to add two more can of broth.  This be a great soup and I definitey plan to make it again.  Thanks Tara. This be a delicious soup. I really love kidney bean so I couldn't resist try this recipe. I'm glad I did. I add a little sugar because my family like some sweetness when tomato be involved. I will definitely make this again. Thanks a lot for sharing! This soup make a delicious and fill lunch that we really enjoyed.  We'll make this again and I think that I will brown the onion with the beef for extra flavor and maybe add some extra broth or even tomato sauce because it be sooo thick (more like a stew than a soup).  This go together quickly and would be great for a week night meal if pre-shredded cabbage be use (I shred my own this time).  Thanks for a great low-carb meal! This be a great soup!  I make it WW friendly by use 8oz Cooked lean grind beef and sub the thyme and bay leaf with 1 T worscheshire (sp) sauce and 2 T splenda (personal preference) this be 3 pt for 1 cup and be a core recipe!  Thanks for sharing!!!! simple, easy, fun (for some reason I love chop cabbage), and good! I add celery and garlic, and spice it up some more with cumin, chili powder, and salt. this be very good.  I didn't have he thyme or bay leaf, so i leave them out, use a can of italian dice tomato since i couldn't find stew - use up some purple cabbage from my CSA that otherwise would have go bad.  Simple, easy, and tasty.  Thanks for post This be the same recipe I use from Sandra Woodruff's Good Carb Cookbook, except she use 12 oz. of lean grind beef. I add a chop cleave of garlic and canellini bean instead of red kidney beans, and some boullion granule and extra water because we like our soup to be more liquidy. I've make this simple soup many time and it's always good. Love this soup. When I make it I add chop up baby carrot (which I pre-cook in the microwave for a few minutes) and a can of Rotel tomato to spice it up a bit.\",\n",
       " ' I really like the fruit and nut do this way. DH like the flavour a lot too but shy away from it because it be so liquidly. I use dark raisin and organic dry apricots. The only change I make be to use blanch sliver almond instead of halve because it be what I have on hand. To compensate I soak them for 15 out of the 45 minutes. The problem I have with this recipe be the fruit and nut be in a very thin liquid at the end. I think to tweak this recipe to a probable 5 star would be to simmer the liquid down slightly to a thin syrup. I like the orange blossom water with this. This be even good chilled. I will try make it again a state above. Made for Ramadan Tag. I have to make a few adjustments.  I use a variety of dry fruit (apples, cranberries, dates, plums, apricots, and the list go on), and pistachio because that what I have on hand.  I soak it for about 24 hours.\\n\\nHowever, I really go crazy, so to speak, when I serve it ala mode!  WOW talk about tasty!  It be good after a 24 hour soak, but two day late it be fabulous.  The fruit be very soft and the liquid be nice and syrupy, not too sweet, full of flavor.  Fantastic! This will be great serve with my yoghurt at breakfast or serve over a slice of cake. I do not add the sugar a the fruit esp the apricot be sweet enough for me. It be so so pretty and versatile too. I soak both fruit and nut overnight like previous reviewer do with a plump and delicious result. Made for ZWT6. While make a write except for the use of sliver almond like another reviewer, I read the prior review & it seem best result be achieve w/longer soak & refrigeration times. So I make it Wed for review today (Fri) & I must say that I cannot imagine how a more ideal result could be achieved. Won over by another reviewer, I also serve it atop ice cream & it really be great. I could not help but wonder if a bite of brandy add prior to refrigeration would be just the thing to send this recipe into 10* territory for me .. almost certainly inconsistent w/the cuisine, but such a nice thot. Thx for post this recipe for us. Very enjoyable! This make a very satisfy dessert that be great on it own or would be good with yogurt or ice cream. I make a write although I do snip my apricot so that everything be about the same size. Also make use the suggest time (really liked), but next time just to compare how the time effect the recipe may try other review suggestion of use whole almond and overnight soak time. Highly recommend this nice healthy dessert, thank for the post.',\n",

       " \" Sue, this be so good, how do I thank you? This taste like it come from the best hotel in the world. It be very flavourful and an extremely good comfort food. I do substitute the butter/margarine with cook oil and the Tobasco sauce with Soy sauce a I didnt have that on hand. Otherwise, I stick to the recipe. One thing that I want to point out be that after the veggie be cook and keep aside, when the rice be add in, it not necessary to stir fry it for 7-8 minute to obtain the light brown colour. The colour come to the light brown shade within 2-3 minute maximum. Keeping the rice without any liquid(stock/water) for 7-8 minute would DEFINITELY result in burn the rice. This be otherwise a perfect recipe for a lunch party! Thanks, will make it the next time we have a party! Very colorful, very flavorful rice.  I use brown rice, next time I'll use white and I'll add the pea at the end of the cook time in order to preserve that beautiful green.   So good. I have make this many times...thought I already review it!  I make it the first time use butter, but since have both cut down on the amount and substitute margarine and it have turn out fine (butter lend a rich flavor, though!) I always use brown rice, cook about 35 minutes, and add the pea the last 5 minutes.  Love it! I decide to venture out of my rice-a-roni rut and this be a great option!  I use boullion cubes, which be pretty salty.  Next time I'll try it with a good quality broth (maybe even homemade if I'm feel ambitious). This be enjoy by both of us. I halve the recipe and didn't use the tabasco sauce. Used dry parsley and dry tyme, never seem to have fresh in the house. I foze up what we didn't eat and just today find it in the freezer and realize I didn't post a review. Very good, thank for the recipe Sue. I have to say this be really good and so full of flavor! I be even shock to see my 3 year old eat it. This be a keeper! Thanks Sue L.... This be tasty!  Next time I would cut down on the parsley (a little overwhelming) and up the thyme and omit the pepper altogether.  I might also toss in some pine nuts.  Thanks for the recipe. :) This be great!  Very tasty.  My MOTHER want the recipe--HUGE compliment!  I now make it quite often when use rice a a side dish. Thanx! Terrific!  Used red pepper instead of green(personal taste thing) and some finely chop zucchini.  Added golden raisin and pistachio toward the end of simmer time.  Beautiful dish when plat and very tasty serve with roast game hen halve This be very tasty and flavorful rice. I serve this with grill shrimp and my family love it. Thank you for share this wonderful, easy recipe...it be definitely a keeper. This be a keeper. I add everything except the Tabasco sauce and it come out fine.  Also, next time I make it I will omit the parsley a I couldn't even taste it in the rice. This be great - a real keeper.  I add mushroom instead of green pepper (my hubby hat them) and omit the Tabasco because my kid be really sensitive to anything spicy.  I also use 2 cup of chicken broth and a quarter cup of water - this be plenty, the rice be perfect.  The flavor be great, nothing too over powering... blend very nicely.  Perfect compliment to a lemon pepper turkey breast and steam green beans.  Delicious! Very good rice pilaf, have make it several time now. Made this last night for dinner and serve with Recipe#123869#123869 and Recipe#125146#125146. DH say I could make this anytime. I cut the recipe in half and use jasmine rice and follow the direction completely. Next time I might add the pea at the last minute but this be DELICIOUS! Thank you. Made for Herb of the Month: Thyme French Forum 2010. I enjoy this very much, thank for a great dinner. Excellent rice recipe! Love all the flavor and color. I add more veggie and have to skip the parsley because I be out. DH and I both love it. I&#039;m look forward to make this a a side for kebabs. Thanks for share this keeper recipe. This be really good! I follow the recipe exactly, except I reduce the amount of liquid (chicken broth and water) just like another reviewer suggested. The result be savory, fragrant deliciousness. Made this tonight for dinner to go with saute flounder. My family RAVED about it. I didn't have chicken broth so I just use water and it be still very flavorful. I also leave out the peas, parsley and tabasco (personal preference). I only use 1 cup of rice (Jasmine) with 1.5 cup water and adjust the veggie volume. Now I wish I'd make more because it be so tasty!\",\n",
       " ' This be have way to much lemon flavor which really overpower all of the other ingredients. Next time I will cut the lemon down to 1 tablespoon. If it need more I can add it, but it be impossible to subtract it. Made for Bargain Basement tag game. I halve the recipe a there be only 2 of us. The bbq flavor be very nice. I would have like a little more of a pronounce dill taste though. :)',\n",
       " ' I make these for my grandson\\'s Easter basket, and they come out great!  I make them with chicken and bunny and use the speckle Cadbury Easter Eggs for the egg in the basket.  Very cute! My boy and I make these together for our dessert tray.  It be lot of fun and they look great!  Thanks for the cute idea! Cute...fun...and easy to make!  I use Reese\\'s bunny (unwrapped) and peanut butter M&M\\'s for decorations.  Thanks for sharing! This be a really fun,easy and\\r\\nvery tasty recipe. Loved by\\r\\nyoung and old both. Thank You!! Great recipe. I saw lot of recipe for this idea, but this one be the only one that include chocolate!   The only thing I do differently be that I didn\\'t form my nest in the muffin tin. I drop them by generous spoonful onto wax paper so they be more \"free-formed.\" I think they look much more natural that way. (See the pic I submitted.) I garnish with Peeps and M&M\\'s speckle eggs. No-one in my family really like these.  Too greasy and salty. Loved these so much this past Easter! I can\\'t believe I forget to review them. I make a couple large one in a big muffin tin and then a full tin of the mini muffin ones. They all turn out so cute and delicious with the peanut M&M center and they be tasty to boot! :)  Thank you!',\n",
       " ' This be different than how I make sausage gravy. I will try this! Sounds easy than my way. This be a all most foolproof recipe.  I use this to fee 9 men at a church breakfest, and the love it.  I\\'ve always have trouble make gravy thick enough, or with out lumps, but not with this one.  It\\'s Great! This be a great breakfast, for more flavor try leave a tablespoon of the grease in the gravy and for a kick try cayenne pepper.  Mmm good! I make this for my husband and he really enjoy them.  It be so easy to make and have a lot of taste to it. I\\'ve be make this exact recipe for year and my family love it for Sunday breakfast. The only thing I add be just a pinch of salt. I also cook the flour and sausage for 2-3 minute before add the milk to burn off the \"floury\" taste. Great recipe! I just make this for breakfast and it be so great! Super easy and really fill also. We really enjoy it. I didn\\'t make a single substitution or alteration, this recipe be perfect the way it is. Thanks so much for posting. This be just wonderful the way it is. We use bread. Nothing leave but the pan. \\r\\nThank You Very good!  I\\'m ashamed to say that I\\'ve be make this from a mix from a bakery, and it be so wonderful to find an recipe from scratch that be just a good!  I leave the fat in from the sausage and add just a little salt.  Very delicious!  Will probably make this every Saturday morning.  Thank you for posting! WONDERFUL! I wouldn\\'t change a thing about it!!! Thanks for posting! This be great, I add cayenne pepper to it and it be yummy, and I love how easy it be too, thanks! I have no problem admit that I\\'m no cook.  I be very anxious when I be ask to bring a food item to a breakfast potluck we be have at work one day.  I find this recipe and it look easy enough so I make the gravy and take it to work.  I be relieve to see that two other lady have also bring gravy (just in case mine be no good). Well, I work in a medical clinic and it be particularly busy that day so I didn\\'t get to eat for several hours.  When I go into the breakroom, I be shock to see that my gravy be go and the other two gravy be barely touched.  I didn\\'t get to taste the gravy I have make so that night when I get home from work, I make biscuit and gravy for dinner.  I have to say, this be the BEST gravy I have ever had!  It turn out so wonderfully and now I can say that there be ONE food item that I can make that actually taste good! This recipe be great!  It be also very easy to make for somebody that can\\'t ever seem to get the lump out. I make this for breakfast this morning, and everyone enjoy it.  I do like several people suggest and let the flour cook with the sausage a bite before add the milk, plus I leave a tad of the sausage dripping in the pan.  It turn out great, no lumps, and just thick enough.  It be really easy to make; this will probably become a regular breakfast in our home.  Thanks!! Thanks for this recipe!  I have a hard time get sausage gravy to thicken in the past, but this help a lot.  One caution:  My husband accidentally pick up some sort of diet or low fat sausage.  Unless you be on a strict diet please get regular sausage.  The diet stuff be tasteless!  Just a tip  :-) This be great! I din\\'t change a thing. Thank you for share this recipe. I make this gravy and it be the first time I have ever make gravy...much to my disappointment, it do not turn out very well!! I think because I try to use skim milk (?) I have make this twice now, and here be what I learn from the first time: cook this slowly.  The first time I make it I be in a hurry, so the sausage didn\\'t break up a much and the gravy be not that flavorful.  Please note that this be all my fault.\\r\\n\\r\\nThen, for a family vacation I cook breakfast and double this recipe.  I cook the sausage slow and also thicken the gravy slowly.  I have to say that this be perfect.  Better than any restaurant I can remember.  I think the only thing I do any differently be to use quite a bite of pepper and add some salt.  Both personal preferences, not flaw in the recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI\\'ll make this forever for breakfasts.  Thanks! WHAT DID I DO WRONG? OK I know it be mme and not the recipe because everyone rave about it, but mine do not thicken at all! It be runny with chunk (sausage)\\r\\nThe flavor be wonderful, Hubby and daughter like the taste but I wish I make it thicker..\\r\\nIs it suppose to thicken? I swear I follow this recipe exactly....\\r\\nI would rate it a 5 if it be thick.... Thanks for the recipe, love it.  It be so easy to make and taste great the next day in our lunch. This be wonderful!  I make this at least once a month for breakfast and have the leftover for supper the next day. Great recipe!  So simple and so good.  I follow the advice from one of the review and try not to rush through cook this -I make sure the flour be brown well and add the milk slowly.  I do substitute half and half for part of the milk, because that\\'s what I have on hand.  I also pepper it up a bit, and add a little poultry season and chive to it.  Everyone enjoy it -thank so much! B&G (Biscuits and Gravy)has be a favorite of mine since childhood. This recipe make EXCELLENT gravy and be a lot simple than the way I use before. I add a quarter teaspoon each of salt and cayenne. Other than that I go \\'by the book\\'.A neat trick to break up grind meat be to attack them with an old fashion zig-zag wire potato masher, just work it through the meat again and again \\'til it\\'s reduce to the desire size chunks. Thanks! This be very good and simple to make.  I have be look for a sausage gravy recipe for a long time and have none in any of my cookbooks.  This come out even good than the store buy mix I have use for years!  Thank you! First time I make the recipe it be very close but still taste a little floury.  Next time I cook the flour with the sausage and add about 3/4 cup bacon dripping and it be mouth watering.  I give the recipe to all my bud and they be hooked. This be great! I use chop up Maple flavor sausage and some paprika. It be very flavorful. I think I will use the leftover on my pork chop tonight. - Thanks I try this recipe and it be delicious. I love it. Even my 4 yr old enjoy the sausage gravy. What more could you ask for.  I make this today for the hubby and his friend and they all say it be the best sausage gravy they have ever had.  I do use a bite more pepper to satisfy their need for some kick.  I love how easy it be to make something they all appreciate so much. I have always make sausage gravy the hard way.  Never again!  This taste just a good.  I also add some soul season for some extra zip.  This be definately go to stay in my cookbook.  I have also be tell all my friend how wonderful it is.  Thanks again! Delicious and so easy. Used low fat sausage and 2% milk; add a little bite of salt and just a tiny pinch of cayenne pepper and it be fabulous. My DH be a huge fan of biscuit and gravy and now I can finally make them for him at home. Thanks! This be my 1st attempt at sausage gravy and it be super easy and taste great.  My husband say it\\'s good than his mom\\'s (and that be always a good thing!)\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks a lot! Wonderful, what else can one say? Please make sure to cook the flour into the saugage for a good 5-8 min before add the milk, it make a big difference on the flavor. If you like the taste of flour in your gravy ignore that part of my advice! Also, I use cake flour a it\\'s a bite finer, silky and the flavor didn\\'t change much, but I didn\\'t taste the \"flour\". Great recipe, to add to any collection. Thanks for a keeper! Great gravy! It really be delicious over the biscuits. I season my sausage while fry with McCormicks Montreal Seasoning and a touch of accent to enhance the flavor more. It be delicious! Thanks for sharing!    I have make this recipe for years, and I love it.  I do read all the reviews, and to those who have trouble with it not become thick...you must slowly bring it back up to a bubble boil before it will thicken completely.  Love this stuff.\\r\\n i love this recipe every one tell me that be the bet  biscuit and gray they ever  have , i also leave some gease in the pan nad mix the flour and  1/2c.milk together  I\\'ve make this recipe many time and it be very very good.  A good recipe to serve to my 2 kid and their friends.  I never just make one batch, I always double it!  Yummy Yum :) One of my husband\\'s favorite meal be biscuit and gravy and I didn\\'t want to dissappoint him with my first time attempt it.  I accompany this recipe with Cheddar Biscuits #9494 and his response exactly: \"You be make this again... these be the BEST biscuit and gravy I have have in my life.\"\\r\\nOK... guess I\\'ll be make this over and over!  Thanks for the simple recipe! My grandma rarely make sausage gravy because she say it take a long time. But this recipe be really short and easy. I sprinkle some sage into the sausage for extra flavor. The texture be too runny to make it a five for me, but I want to try it again use whole milk and spicy sausage.  Thank you for posting.  I know how to make sausage gravy but it have be so long I want to make sure I get the consistancy right. Thank you again,\\r\\nRachel Castle My husband and coworker say this be very good.  I find it to be too plain.  The second time I try the recipe, I use hot/spicy sausage.   This be great.  I leave a little bite of grease in the pan - otherwise make a directed.  My DH be all about bland, so I use extra mild sausage any time we have it.  He practically lick his plate clean, and I add a bunch of pepper to mine to make up the difference.  Very yummy.  Thank you very much! I have be a \"country girl\" my entire life and i have never make gravy! The woman in my family laugh at me when we be all together in the kitchen. I usually end up the kid chaser and dishwasher! WELL!! Not anymore! I make gravy for the 1st time use this recipe and it come out perfect! I use a hog we butch so it have very little grease to it so there be nothing to drain for me. After cook the sausage i sprinkle the flour on top and cook it on medium heat for about 10 minute then put the milk in and cook it slowly until it thickened. The girl will die when they see how easy and tasty this is. They make theirs the HARD way!! HAHAHA.Thanks That jodygirl!! you make me a happy girl GREAT!!! i have make these many time now, make my own biscuit from bisquick, only alteration i make be more pepper. THESE ARE THE BEST!!! Thanks for thye recipe Jodi, keeper in my household Outstanding recipe! Very similar to the one I\\'ve be make for years, but I cook the flour into the sausage for a few minute before the milk go in to cook away the flour taste.  I love sausage gravy & biscuits, but it\\'s generally a very high fat recipe.  I lighten this recipe a bite by use 1/3 le fat pork sausage, 2 1/2 cup Skim Milk, and a dash of Red Pepper Flakes for heat.  This alteration doesn\\'t change the taste at all, but it do greatly reduce the calories. Great recipe, remind me of the simple and delicious sausage gravy that my grandmother would make for me while I be a young girl back in Virginia.  Thanks! Great!  Easy! A Keeper!  I have never make biscuit and gravy before, because I think it be a lot of work--not with this recipe.  I didn\\'t need to drain the sausage and take B Marlatt\\'s tip and add some cayenne.  Yum! I use Bergy\\'s biscuit <a href=\"/17227\">Buttery Farm Biscuits</a> for the biscuit and breakfast be a hit!  Thanks for share ThatJodiGirl! Great recipe!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis be the same way that my MIL make her gravy, but she just \"eyeballs\" it and I can never make it like hers.  Now I can, hehe!  Thanks for post this!\\r\\n\\r\\n*I use turkey breakfast sausage to lighten this up.  I also add a touch of sage and salt. great recipe & simple.  I add a little worsceister sauce & it taste even better. Very easy way to make sausage and gravy.  I use a low-fat sausage and in place of the can biscuit I make recipe #95314.  This go very well with Recipe #118363 and fresh melon. This be the recipe I use after use a different one for years. I love how simple and CREAMY this one is! I be please at how quickly this breakfast come together.  I be expect the gravy to be a bite thick and even add more \"flour slurry\" to increase the viscosity, but it be still a little runny, but tasty notheless.  I\\'m glad to have a homemade sausage gravy recipe to use again and again.  Thanks! I make this for Christmas breakfast and it be a big hit with my family.  My husband call it come-back gravy because it make him want to come back for more!  Thanks! A great base recipe for sausage gravy. I use spicy italian sausage and add a little paprika too. Served with MarieAlice\\'s Baking Powder Biscuits #87258.  I agree with a previous reviewer about cook the flour with the sausage--not only do it get rid of the floury taste, but it also help to thicken the sauce more quickly (also, add the milk slowly in a steady stream).  However, this still thicken up even while we add the milk all at once; it just take a little while.  Thanks for the great recipe! Easiest way to make sausage gravy!  No more separate pans.  Thanks for posting. Pretty good.  Needed to add salt and think it would be good with half the sausage.  Very rich. OH YEAH!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nI make this gravy use my All Purpose Gluten Free flour mix, and it be P-E-R-F-E-C-T!!! Thank you!! This be excellent gravy. We really enjoy it. A little too much sausage to gravy ratio for me, but that\\'s just my taste. Next time I\\'ll probably use a half pound of sausage. Thanks for a great recipe. Will make often. This be a yummy recipe.  I have be make my sausage gravy like this for many years.  I usually add more flour and milk but the basic preporation be the same. I know everyone will enjoy this if they try it......thanks for posting, Stephanie This be the recipe I use all the time now. We LOVE biscuit and gravy and this be so great-thank you! Made, leave a tablespoon of fat in the skillet and cook the flour and milk for a couple minutes.  Absolutely delicious.  Thank you for a wonderful recipe that I\\'ll use again. This be very good and will make again.  It be so easy to make the gravy I no long have to buy the package stuff!  Thanks!! This do not come out at all for me, and base on all the glow reviews, I\\'m wonder if I do something wrong.  I follow the direction and even measure ingredient (which I don\\'t often do, LOL), yet we couldn\\'t even eat this.  It didn\\'t thicken up even after cook a while at med-high heat, so I finally add a little more flour, and that, of course, make it just taste like flour.  I\\'m not give any star because if 58 other people have try this, I surely must have do something wrong... thank anyway! Awesome Gravy, new favorite at our house. Don\\'t miss this recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI also use maple flavor sausage, which definately add a unique flavor to the recipe. Very simple recipe, but strong on flavor.\\r\\n\\r\\nFor those of you who store / rotate food, I use powder milk instead of regular and there be no way to tell the difference. Enjoy !!!! Used the technique others suggest - brown flour first, cook slowly, add some salt.  Yummo!!!!  Very, very easy I have a terrible time make gravy but this one work wonderfully! Outstanding...delicious.  I just happen to have a bite of heavy cream in fridge and substitute 1 cup of cream plus 3 cup milk.  The gravy turn out very rich and creamy.  I plan to make this again and again!!! Very quick and easy to make. \\r\\n\\r\\nthanks,\\r\\nDeana (Lexington, SC) Wonderful!  I use only a 12 oz pkg of low fat Jimmy Dean sausage and then 1/4 c. flour and 2 cup milk.  I also add a little salt with the pepper.  Thank you so much, ThatJodiGirl! Perfect! Made this for a church brunch and people scrap the bottom of the pot to get the last little bit. So simple to make with fantastic results. This be so yummy!  I can\\'t believe I forget to rate it!  Well, I be back and can\\'t wait!  Thanks for posting!  It be so easy! It reheat perfect the next day and have my co-worker drooling.   I use jimmy\\'s hot sausage and it be not red, it be perfect.  Today I be try the maple flavor. This be my first attempt at sausage gravy from scratch.  I have no idea it would be so easy!  This be really tasty.  I have half a pound of turkey sausage leave over that I want to use today.  I reheat it in the skillet and halve the recipe.  It come out great.  Half make just enough for me and my three small boys.  If this Yank can do it, anyone can. This be ok, but I have much high hop consider the reviews. No one at my house really eat it.  I guess I\\'m just use to my mamaws sausage gravy. This be perfect! I want to make some gravy this morning but be sure of the correct \\'ratios\\'. I have no problem with it thickenening. I do add alot more than a dash of pepper. I want to just sit down with a bowl of the gravy and forget about the bisquits! Yum! This remind me of the sausage gravy my mom use to make. It be much easy than I think it would be, and it be delicious! Reminds me of Grandma\\'s gravy! MmMm Good!  Soooo easy and delic!  Everyone enjoyed! This be very yummy and easy to make.  My husband put it over his fry chicken...I know...just a heart attack wait to happen.  Good thing he\\'s thin and healthy.  It\\'s a keeper!  Thanks for sharing. I have struggle for year to find that perfect recipe for sausage gravy.  THIS IS IT!  I make them Thanksgiving morning and at least once a week since.  Thank you!!!!!! This i a good to eat a it be simple to make... This be so good and soo easy! I use 12 ounce of reduce fat sausage, 1/4 cup of flour, 3 cup of milk, and a bite of salt and pepper. It be hands-down the best sausage gravy I have ever had! Great recipe. I use the freeze Pillsbury Grands in a bag. My husband like them good than mine make by scratch. We just have these for Christmas morning. Yum. I give this 3 stars. My 5 yr old newphew and I really like this gravy. I make drop biscuit and have this gravy over them for our Breakfast For Dinner. I use breakfast pork sausage. I be a bite concern over the amount of milk and a it cook I be even more concerned. It take my gravy about 20 minute to thicken. I have a electric stave so maybe that be why. At first the gravy seem very thin but a I let it cook it thicken and after it cool it be very thick just like I like my sausage gravy. Overall this be a very good sausage gravy and I will have make this again. Thanks for post a really good recipe. Christine (internetnut) It be good, but we prefer a whiter, thin gravy. Perfect!  We make this for Christmas breakfast for the second year in a row. This one\\'s a keeper! Very good recipe.  I only use 3 cup of milk and it come out splendid.  There be plenty. This just didn\\'t have enough flavor for us. Sorry. Great basic sausage gravy recipe.  I use Jimmy Dean low fat sausage and skim milk.  Still work great and low the fat content some.  To the reviewer that state there wasn\\'t enough flavor, it all depend on the type of sausage you use.  I would recommend try a sage or hot sausage to help improve the flavor.  However, that say this be the way I be teach sausage gravy be suppose to taste. I just love sausage gravy and biscuits!  There be so many recipe on \\'Zaar for sausage gray.  I have no idea what make me settle on this one, but I did.  It be fantastic and so very easy.  For those of you who must be GF, this work very well with an rice flour/cornstarch blend in place of the regular flour.  Thanks for post this Jodi! I be pretty surprise that I like this, actually!  (Sorry if that sound rude!)  We\\'re not really sausage eater but I have some in the freezer that need to be eat so I think this look like good comfort food.  It be extremely easy AND inexpensive.  Thanks! I serve your recipe to a group of camper and have rave reviews.  It be easy to put together and be so good!  So much good than go out for sausage and biscuit which be usually tasteless.  Thanks for posting!! This be very good and easy. I think I be go to have a soupy mess at first. It really seem like a lot of milk. Patience be definitely important here. Just let it simmer and bubble away and it thicken quite nicely. This be the same sausage gravy I make except I use hot sausage and a little mince onion.  Good stuff! This be a Great gravy!  I also think I add too much milk, but a someone say earlier, be patient, it thicken up.  This gravy be definitely a keeper! God Bless! Delicious.  I do take the advice of other reviewer and cook the flour and sausage for 6 minute before add the milk to get rid of the flour taste.  I also add Worcestershire sauce, salt and Frank\\'s red hot for additional seasoning. Super-quick breakfast idea.  I halve the recipe and my old son love it.  Thanks. This recipe be the easy and best gravy recipe on here! I use hot sausage in mine and it turn out perfect every time! Thank you so much for share this with u The family just leave the table say \\'oh, I eat too much!\" A fine compliment. We have breakfast for dinner and make this recipe. Simple and delicious, my favorite kind of recipe! Thanks so much for sharing. My BF and I make this on Christmas morning.  It be suppose to be a present for his dad, but everyone else love it too!  It be fantastic!  Everyone (even the picky eaters) gobble it right up.  Not only that,  everyone say that Sausage Gravy usually give them heartburn, but this do not at all!  Not even late in the day.  It be simple, with great portions, perfect direction and taste delicious.  Five star isn\\'t enough! I just have a few thing to say about this recipe...Easy, Tasty, and Delicious!! I substitute turkey for pork and add a dash of salt before serve over biscuits. Will definitely make again. Thanks! I make Recipe #220639, and then make this gravy to pour over the top.  We love it for breakfast along with some egg over easy and home fries.  This be so easy to make, and with the homemade biscuits, it be deeeelicious! We just have this for dinner and it be yummy, cheap and oh, so easy.  I want to low the fat a bite so I rinse the sausage after browning, return it to the pan and add the flour.  It thicken up nicely and all 5 of u love it.  It will have a regular place on our dinner and breakfast menus! Thanks! Gravy be delicious serve over whip potatoes.  I substitute bison sausage, and I add 1/8 teaspoon cayenne pepper and 1/8 teaspoon salt. I have be make this for years, only I add a dash of Worchestershire Sauce to the mix. YUMMY! This be a fabulous gravy. Very simple to make, and no worry about lumps. And very satisfying. I do add salt and use a little half and half with my milk. Thanks! As everyone else states, great recipe! The only change I make be use turkey sausage instead of pork, and since it have so little fat, I didn\\'t drain from the pan. I also add alittle worcestershire sauce, per some other reviewer suggestions. \\nWill most definitely put in the \"keeper\" file... thank you so much! This be so good over Recipe #220639.  The muffin be tender and delicious and the gravy be load with flavor and make your mouth water!  Homemade biscuit be always good than store buy and only take a few minute to make.  So worth the time and energy, especially for this recipe! Perfect!!! This be the first time I ever make sausage gravy and OMG, how easy it was!  My husband eat it with spoon he like it so much, and he\\'s a country boy!  Who knew?!?  Thanks for a great, easy recipe. Very easy and really tasty. Here be my additions. I use a hot sausage, add cayenne, lot of fresh grind pepper and I also add finely dice red bell pepper. Cook slowly and use a little more cake flour for a thick gravy. Made it last weekend and it be a success. Delicious and easy to make! This be very tasty and easy.  I think I might prefer the sausage to be a bite spic next time, so I think I\\'ll add some red pepper flake - but the recipe by itself be just wonderful! I need to make something for a school breakfast so another parent and I get together and agree that she\\'d make the biscuit and I\\'d make the gravy. Having never make gravy before, I do a trial run last night. It come out really good, I just think that it be a little too thick for my taste. I make it again in the morning (multiplied by 2.5) for the school thing and leave out just a little bite of flour (about a tablespoon) and it come out GREAT. I put it in a crockpot, set it to WARM and take it to school. I hope it maintain the wonderful consistency. \\nI find out that it\\'s important to drain the fat: last night I didn\\'t drain it and the gravy form this skin on top, but this morning I drain the fat and it didn\\'t form the skin. Again, it come out great, I would definitely make this again. It wouldn\\'t get thick. I be not sure what go wrong but it be like water. I use only 3.5 cup of milk a it seem like a bite much, lucky I do because I fear it would have be too runny with any more. Overall a nice creamy sauce. This too be the same recipe I use for gravy. But, I learn something I be excite to try. Cooking the flour with the sausage. I have always pour the milk in my pan, leave a little milk in the bottom of my cup, add a couple tbsp of flour in the leftover milk and mix that together and then pour that into my pan. I do read a couple of review on lumpy or thin gravy. You never want to add a thickener (you could also use corn starch) to a hot liquid. It will never mix right. Add it to cold or room temp liquid even if it\\'s just a touch of water, before add it to the pan. bring it to a light boil and then back the heat back down to a simmer and let it thicken. Then it will thicken with out lump or if you\\'ve make your gravy and feel it too thin, you can use the same method. But don\\'t jump the gun too early on add extra flour, once it start thicken you may find it too thick! This an awesome recipe.  I need a gallon of gravy so I have to time it by 4.  I also use pork and bacon sausage by Farmland--very flavorful.  I also add some salt a a personal preference.  It will sit overnight for the brunch tomorrow, so I know the flavor will be even better.  I be now go to make simple biscuit use heavy cream and recipe #263699. SOOOO incredibly easy to make! I just LOVE that there be only 3 basic ingredient and the fact that you can modify the gravy to your tastes! We like a \\'HEARTY\\' gravy, so I add a little bite more flour for a thick gravy, plus we LOVE the peppercorn, so in go a few extra \\'dashes\\'! Plus, I reserve a few tablespoon of fat to give it that \\'down-home-southern\\' taste! And finally, if you need more, just double or triple the recipe! I take this to work for the guys, and barely get any for myself! I learn to make gravy from my mom and it be usually very good, but there be no steady proportion - just by feel. My gravy start to be consistently too thin so I look for a recipe and find this one. It\\'s perfect. Sometimes I halve it, usually I don\\'t. Beautiful, thick gravy. \\nAdding a bite of red pepper be often fantastic a well, give it a go! \\n\\nThank you! Was look for a basic recipe. Tried this one.  Needed LOTS of pepper. Was wayyyyy too thin for me.  Would use maybe 1/3 to 1/2 a much milk next time for that amount of flour. I use some sausage I have pre-cooked and freeze so I think it didn\\'t have quite a much grease leave to bind with the flour.  Still a good recipe.  Thanks! Very yummy and simple.  I add a pinch of sea salt and about 1 teaspoon of black pepper and make my biscuit from scratch. Will consider serve again for potluck one Sunday morning at church.<br/><br/>For those who think it be too thin, you probably do not cook it long enough.  Mine be almost too thick. My family have be bug me for age to make biscuit and gravy and it finally get to me. So I come across your recipe and it really wow the family even the picky eaters! I think that the gravy be go to be a bite plain but it be perfect! Thank you so much for this wonderful recipe! :) Easy, quick, tasty. I add a couple dash of Worcestershire sauce. I buy Jimmy Dean\\'s Reduced Fat Sausage... it\\'s only 12 oz, so I use 1/4 cup flour and 1 3/4 cup milk.  It be soooo thick that next time I\\'ll use the whole pint!  Very delicious! this be very good. It be extremely thick so next time i will use more milk. I also use turkey sausage instead of the pork sausage. yum Ds and I both love this over Mile High Biscuits!  Rich and filling! yummy! Yum!  I make it exactly like the recipe say and it turn out perfect!  Thank you for this great and easy recipe! This really be so simple.  We use whole milk, it take a long time to thicken so we add a very small amount of flour to help it along.  Remember people-when you take it off the burner and the gravy cool down, it will thicken by itself a little.  Added a little salt and lotsa pepper ( we like it that way).  I be out of sausage so I have to use grind beef, so we add sugar to help the beef taste more like sausage.  Can\\'t wait to make it again, thank for posting. This be really wonderful gravy, and so simple! I have always remove the brown sausage from the pan, make the roux, add the milk and then add the meat back when the gravy be almost finished. I honestly don\\'t know why I do it that way (Grandma always did) but it just create another dish to wash. This be much quicker. I also never think to add Worcestershire sauce, but it really add an extra layer of flavor. Don\\'t make the mistake I do though, if you\\'re use spicy hot sausage, you probably don\\'t want to add the red pepper flake a well. I do it without think about it, and it be melt-your-face-off spicy. DH love this, but he\\'s weird. I guess he\\'ll have a lot of leftovers. ;) Didn\\'t realize how easy it would be to make tasty sausage gravy!  Definitely add some salt and more pepper to taste.  I use a rosemary breakfast sausage from our local butch but I imagine that add a little rosemary to regular breakfast sausage would be pretty yummy too!  Awesome recipe and super easy and quick to make! This gravy be awesome.  I follow the advice of another reviewer and remove the sausage, make the roux and then add it back when the gravy have thicken a bit.  Added the worcerstershire sauce (about a tablespoon) and find it didn\\'t need add salt or additional spice other than the black pepper.  Easy to make and enjoy by all.  My husband say it be the best gravy he\\'s ever had.  Made homemade biscuit to go with it and it be over-the-top good! Good, Yummy, and easy :).  Just the way a bachelor like it. I halve the recipe and eat the gravy over whole wheat toast.  The next day I heat up the gravey to go over a plain egg omelette.  Tasted great both ways.  Thanks for post ThatJodiGirl. Very good. I make a half recipe. I also even use a 1/4 le milk than half quantity. (wanted it even thicker)  I use skim milk since that\\'s what I had. It be good cause the sausage be rich. Note to self: Would be good with regular milk. Used the sausage from Round Hill, VA roadside store. Felt like I wake up in the mountain eat this breakfast. Yummy. I make this for a brunch that I catered.  I\\'d never make homemade sausage gravy before but it be super easy and delicious!!  Definite comfort food!  I cook my sausage gravy and then keep it warm in a crockpot.  Everyone love it! This be an excellent base recipe for sausage gravy. But don\\'t let the grease go to waste by drain it off. Just brown the sausage long then add more flour to absorb the grease and it flavor. If can, to find Blue & Gold Sausage. It be sell a school fundraisers. I like to add just a little of liquid hickory smoke. It give your gravy a campfire touch. But for the ultimate fill breakfast, serve your gravy over a buttered, bake potato. yummy yum!!!! Super easy and turn out so good, plus it look like I slaved.  Other half say it be a definite do again. Thanks for the recipe.  :D This be how I\\'ve always make my sausage gravy.  Super good.  I use Jimmy Dean Hot Sausage.  Gives it extra flavor and isn\\'t too hot for more tender mouths.  And of course you have to use Grands Biscuits. Yum! This be a keeper! I have never make this type of gravy before, and it be perfect. Hubby say we could have it every week (as he polish off half of it!). I use Jimmy Dean hot sausage, a teaspoon or more of kosher salt, and a very generous dash of black pepper. Would be great for brunches, a quick weeknight supper, for breakfast when have overnight guests, etc. Thanks for posting. I follow this recipe exactly and it turn out fantastic!  Best recipe ever for sausage gravy.  Note:  it do take a while to thicken, and I be tempt to add extra flour, but don\\'t.  It will thicken up nicely.  I can\\'t wait to make it again. This be so good.  I add some fresh sage and it be out of this world.  Thanks! Oh man!......oh man!....... Delicious! Loved it. My first success at make gravy :) I&#039;ve never make homemade sausage gravy before. I&#039;ve always be too intimate to make it. I come across this recipe and I have everything on hand, so I go for it! I be so happy and excite about this recipe! It be so easy and it taste wonderful!!! I add quite a bite of pepper just because I really love how it taste in sausage gravy and I add a little salt. It be perfect and come together in a breeze!! Love it! Thank you! This be a great recipe with simple ingredient and it&#039;s so easy to make.  Why would anyone ever use a mix?  I like that you can adjust the amount of pepper, something that you can&#039;t do with a mix.  This recipe be a winner. Awesome, read the tip to cook long with the flour and make it with maple sausage.  Easiest I have ever make and come out perfect.  Will never make it any other way. A great basic gravy recipe, for add flavor I add a few dash of worchestire sauce, some onion powder, a dash of garlic powder, season salt and pepper. For an extra kick, I add a dash of jalepeno sauce. Delicious! Good! Used Jimmy Dean natural sausage and whole milk. Added 1t salt and a couple of shake of Worcestershire sauce. Will make again. Thanks for share the recipe! My Hubby request biscuit and gravy for breakfast, so I search and find this recipe. Simple to put together, come out perfectly, and no need to pull out ton of pan and make a big old mess.  Best of all, he&#039;s excite when I serve this for breakfast. Thanks so much for help me make Hubby happy! :D I just make biscuit and gravy for the first time with this recipe it come out great very easy and tasty. I didn&#039;t drain the grease because the sausage I use didn&#039;t really have any after I brown it and I use three cup of skim milk instead of a quart. I will definitely make it again. Thanks! I never make this before, and it get restaurant perfect! I make it exactly a the direction specified, and my husband gobble it up. I may add some thyme or garlic next time, but it be a great recipe a written. My 7 year old niece, Anna, spend the weekend with my family and she be a super picky eater. On the weekend we let the kid pick what&#039;s for dinner. The vote be breakfast for dinner and my step kid both want biscuit and sausage gravy. It&#039;s something I&#039;ve never make before, so I use this recipe.  It be the first time that I have ever see Anna ask for a second serving! Usually she eat a few bites, then cry that she&#039;s full. My family give this all thumb up, which mean the recipe be a keeper! Something be missing, just overall not a lot of flavor, if I do it again I would not drain all the fat out and I would add something so the roux have more flavor. Loved it!! Followed recipe except leave about a tablespoon of the drain grease in the pan with the sausage. And also I only need about 3 1/2 cup of milk!!!  Simple and delish!!! Thanks for sharing!! The sausage gravy itself be good. I use fresh crack pepper set on a coarse grind. But I highly recommend either make your biscuit from scratch (they be not hard to make!) or the Pillbury FROZEN southern-style biscuits. There\\'s a huge difference in the texture of the biscuit and it do impact the absorption quality of the gravy. I find the biscuit from a can end up slimy with the gravy. In a pinch, run to Popeye\\'s or KFC the night before and buy a half dozen biscuits. While we think this be good, it do lack in flavor. Next time I will definitely add some season in addition to the pepper. This be a wonderful basic recipe. I add a couple dash of hot sauce, Worcestershire, onion powder, Lawry\\'s, black pepper and a little Italian seasoning. I use Neese\\'s sausage and it have just the right amount of dripping and I do not have to drain but cut the recipe in half for two. I have to share the way I serve it, open up a bake biscuit on a plate, top with hashbrowns, two fry egg and sausage gravy on top, OMGOSH. This be so easy and delicious! It didn’t look very pretty because I use hot Italian sausage and it make the gravy a weird orange color, but it taste really good and I’ll definitely make it again sometime. It\\'s official. This be the easy way to make country sausage gravy! Not only the easy but it\\'s the best taste too. I follow this recipe exactly except for add some Slap Ya Mama Cajun season to the milk. My husband and I don\\'t eat this way very often, but it\\'s nice to know that when you need some southern comfort food, it\\'s this easy to make it!',\n",
       " ' This be yummy!  I make it with light cranberry juice and Splenda.  It be fine, although the full-sugared version might be better.  I use salt-free, good-quality can beet a the fresh be sky-high expensive.',\n",
       " \" This be pretty tasty. I have very little prior experience with bulgur so didn't know what to expect from that ingredient - the overall taste of the salad be nice but the texture of the bulgur will take some get use to. After 15 min. soak there be a lot of liquid leave so I let it go another 15 min. and most of the liquid be go then. Doubled the recipe and it make good, easy lunch for a couple days. Thanks for the recipe!\",\n",

       " \" What a perfect way to enjoy the strawberry that be at the roadside stand at this time of year!  The flavor of the fresh fruit really shin when serve this way.  The entire family enjoy this and decide that we'll make this simple and healthy dessert/snack again.  Maybe next time we'll throw in some dice peaches, kiwi or even blueberries...whatever be in season.  Thanks for a wonderful recipe! We really enjoy this recipe.  I use honey and no orange zest.  I mash some strawberry and chop some.  I'm not sure the chinnamon chip turn out a well a they could have because the recipe doesn't give a temperature.  I use 350, but they take long than 5 minutes.  Will make again and will share this recipe. this be very tasty! i make some minor variation to it though. i didnt put any cinnamon or sugar on the tortilla chips, but just bake them plain.  also, instead of orange zest, which i have none of, i add a little lemon juice and some lettuce to make it a meal! good stuff. healthy, just the way i like it Yummy. The cinnamon chip be the best.\",\n",
       " \" I bring this to work for a mexican pot luck and it get raves.\\r\\nI did, however, make some change accord to my taste. I add 2 chop jalapenos, chop cilantro, a small can of slice black olives, use the juice of 1 lime instead of the lemon, and add some Adobo season and extra cumin.  I use red onion and 1 smallish orange pepper to make it very colorful.  I will definitely make this again, so thank for the recipe. I get such rave review at the 4th of July picnic (no leftovers) I make another batch to bring to my co-workers, along with the recipe! I use red onion a type wasn't mention and after all, what else be there? This just get good a day go by! Next time I'll use hot salsa and maybe some jalapenos. Oh Mama! UPDATE, people keep ask for this recipe, I keep make it again and again, so thank again! Great salad!\\r\\nI use 2 cup brown rice and light kidney bean in the salad .  For the dress I didn't use salsa, put 1/2 teaspoon grind cumin, 1/2 teaspoon grind corriander and 1 teaspoon chili powder.  I garnish with fresh cilantro and some lemon slices.  It turn out very flavorful and pretty too!  Thanks for posting! I be look for something to replace a similar recipe - it use sour cream and salsa for the dress base and I want something non-dairy that could sit out at a party longer. This be really good - tasty and very healthy. I use an orange pepper (not a fan of green), red onion and extra rice. I would like more spice though so next time I'll use hot salsa and add some cilantro a suggest in review (I didn't have any when I make this). This  be a very colourful and tasty salad.  My child don't like chunky salsa so I put all the dress ingredient in the blender for a quick whirl before adding.  They love it. Really nice salad. Great side and great snack. Thanks for the recipe! This be an excellent side or appetizer.  Haven't deviate from the original recipe a it be delicious a submitted.   My family and co-worker really like this one!  Thanks for submitting. Delicious!  I have to use mix bean and dry parsley, but I love it!  Thanks for posting. Yum yum yum! I make my own salsa from a recipe also on this site, omit the pepper, a I have none on hand, and use mix beans. I'm a vegetarian and eat it a a main and it's fresh, delicious, healthy, and satisfying. Thanks! I hate read review or add review where people make so many change a it be no long the original recipe however :) I do omit the salsa (did not have any) use lime juice from the jar (yuck but that be what I have on hand) everything the same.  Used fresh corn on the cob and a dice fresh tomatoe from garden...this be a keeper!\",\n",
       " ' Terrific recipe.  I didn\\'t have ricotta cheese on hand so I use 1 egg instead.   I just grill these on the forman grill.  Worked perfectly at about 6 minutes.  I serve these with a piece of cheese melt over and a side spinach salad.  No bun.  Very healthy and full of flavor.  My husband say \"Make this meal once a week\" It\\'s a keeper! Wonderful, tasty burger.  My husband favorite burger be an Angus beef burger.  I make these and he say \"a must make again, and again, and again\".  I think they be now his favorite, I know they be mine!! Added onion powder, use an egg instead of ricotta and italian season instead of rosemary.  Used 1lb meat since it\\'s what we have but so good could\\'ve use the 2lb.  Toddlers eat it all up!  Tasty, moist...yum! This be a delicious burger.  My family really enjoy this meal.  Have already make it a few times, it\\'s a keeper! Excellent!  My DW love this recipe and it have become part of our rotation.  When cook these, you do have to watch the color and ensure no burning.  I use a instant read thermometer until it be 165 degrees.  Rest it for 5 minute and it come to 170 degrees.  They be moist and perfect.  Thanks for the recipe. Very very nice!!  I despise turkey--don\\'t even like it at holiday dinners--but this be a great way to add a healthy alternative to a weeknight meal.  I halve the recipe and use 1 egg instead of the ricotta.  This make for a very mushy meat mixture when form patties, but it cook up nicely in my Foreman grill (around 7-8 minute in the preheat grill).  Will definitely make again!!! Thank you! For a turkey burger it be not bad. Probably won\\'t repeat it though.  But do appreciate the new flavor. Excellent turkey burger.  I make this recipe exactly a written.  I char the outside a litte, a sugested, and it make the texture perfect...crisp on the outside and moist on the inside.  Very flavorful burger.  Thanks! Wonderful burger!! I follow the other reviewer suggestion and use an egg a a substitute for ricotta cheese because I didn\\'t have any on hand -  but otherwise I follow the recipe a written.   The burger be so flavorful!  Thanks for a keeper! amazing! Thanks for the WONDERFUL recipe!! I double the recipe and use cottage cheese in place of the ricotta and onion powder in place of the rosemary and they be definitely a crowd pleaser! They will be make again and again in this house for sure. (-: Didn\\'t think these be the \"world\\'s best\" at all.  Not very tasty to me.  My BH love turkey burger and think this would be a nice change by add ricotta.  Nope, didn\\'t help.  I feel it need something more to give it a kick, maybe goat cheese would have do it.  Sorry, won\\'t be do again. My husband be skeptical that a turkey burger could be anything but dry - this one change his mind. It be season perfectly and a nice moist burger.  I use an egg instead of the cheese, and add onion powder, so very good.  Will certainly make this again.  Thanks for sharing! These be pretty good, but my husband and I think the dijon mustard taste be quite strong.  Next time I will probably leave that out! I think the ricotta add a nice moistness to the patty. I do add 1/2 saut?ed onion and melt some Gorgonzola on top. The flavone seem well balance and I do not find the mustard taste to be overwhelm in the least. <br/><br/>I will certainly make this again and recommend it to anyone look to add moistness and flavor to grind turkey, Made these on the grill last evening. They be good. Will make again. Only thing I add to the recipe be 1/2 tsp of salt and 1/2 tsp Lawry\\'s season salt.  They hold together very nice on the grill. Did not need to put an egg in the recipe like some of the previous reviewer did. Grilled them 4-5min each side over medium heat and they be nice and juicy. Not dry at all. Thanks for the recipe. This burger have a great flavor and be very juicy. I enjoy it! Good with grind rabbit. Tastes kind of like sausage. Used grind rabbit and cottage cheese instead of ricotta, Then it be a little too soft so I add 1/4 cup dry bread crumbs. I use egg white instead of ricotta, Also repaced the Worcester sauce with soy. Made them on my breville press for about 4 min till internal temp of 175. They be great Wow..this burger be fantastic! Very juicy full of flavor. (I substitute an egg instead of ricotta) My husband love it think this will be a regular at our house! Made this with the recommendation of another reviewer and I didn&#039;t have onion powder so I put onion in it and Italian bread crumb with one egg, but next time I will add a second egg so the burger don&#039;t fall apart and omit the rosemary, everything else I put into the recipe a recommend and everyone couldn&#039;t believe they be turkey burgers. Great recipe... This be so great!  I have try so many different recipe and this one by far be the tasty one I&#039;ve tried.  My husband just love it.  I substitute the cheese for an egg and cook it on a cast iron skillet.  I add some blacken season to it also.  Just amazing.  Thank you so much! I didn&#039;t get to try these myself, but DH give these five stars! Super simple to prep and he grill them with much success. Thanks for post the recipe. These be the best turkey burger I have tried.  I use ricotta cheese and Italian spice instead of the rosemary and thyme.  I grill them on my George Forman grill, and top with Swiss cheese, arugula, and tomato slices.  Some mayo with chop hot pickle jalapenos.  Nice and moist and will definitely save this one to use again GREAT! I especially like that it&#039;s make with no egg and no breadcrumbs. I wasn&#039;t set out to change the recipe, only that I didn&#039;t have some of the ingredients, but it be still amazing! I didn&#039;t have ricotta, so I use cottage cheese. I didn&#039;t have rosemary or thyme, so I use basil and oregano. Perfecto! These be imressive! I ditch the ricotta and use an egg and breadcrumbs.  I have to use fresh rosemary which alwasy scar me because it be a potent spice.  The spice blend well together. Best turkey burger ever!  I saut&eacute; a little finely chop onions, stoplight pepper and mince garlic and let that cool while prepare the rest of the mix.  I mix in the veggie before cooking.  Delicious!  My teenage boy like these burger good than beef burgers.  Wonderful recipe. Wow!  I love this!  It&#039;s so flavorful and will definitely make it again.\\nI didn&#039;t have ricotta cheese so follow a few review and use and egg.\\nI only have 1 lb of grind turkey so halve everything and it turn out great.\\nAs suggested, I add onion powder for more flavor.\\nAs one said, it&#039;s mushy but cook up just right. :)\\nI use my cast iron skillet a per recipe instructions.\\nGreat recipe!  Thanks!! I have not make a turkey burger any other way since find this recipe. However, I make each one of my burger in a 6 cup muffin/cupcake pan and bake them in the oven at 350 for about 25-30 minutes. Depending on your muffin pan size it make small burger that I then put on those Hawaiian Bread buns. A grill bun, a little mayo and ketchup be all I use. Beautiful!!! Thank you for this recipe! Finally a turkey burger with some taste - and without add a lot of fat and calories. Lovely color when do and not too dry. I use Mrs. Dash Roasted Garlic instead of the garlic powder and only use about a quarter of the salt. My only change just because I\\'m watch sodium right now. Perfect! Can\\'t wait to make again! Basically I use these recipe a guide for me to create with what I have in the cupboard... so I make half the recipe use herb de provence instead of rosemary ( a it have rosemary in it), horseradish instead of worstechire and sour cream mix with parmesean instead of ricotta! It be so super delicious, moist, on-point goodness! I have never have a turkey burger that didn\\'t gag me until tonight. All I can say be WOW this recipe be a DEFINITE KEEPER!!! I make this just like the recipe except I be out of thyme and accidentally forget to put in the Djon mustard. The burger be HUGE and absolutely delicious. Follow direction to the T they fell apart in the pan I figure they would I use 3/4 teaspoon of Tony Chachere\\'s instead of salt, a 1/2 teaspoon of oregano, 1 1/2 Tbls of Hellman\\'s mayo, Instead of Dijon I use regular mustard (same amount), three of sprinkle of parsley, 2 shake of McCormick\\'s Montreal Steak seasoning, and a scant of Worcestershire. Baked for 20 minute at 400 over a steam bath with liquid smoke on a rack. I guess I should say it be very seasony.',\n",

       " ' Very good, thank-you, my husband think it be what he call \"sneaky hot\",he enjoy it and want it again. My mouth be still tingley. \\r\\nUsed skinless, legs.\\r\\nThe only problem I have be after the first 6 minute I take the chicken out to turn it over and the sauce have heavily congealed, so I spoon it into a cup and pour 3 or 4 more tablespoon of sherry in and whisk it up, put the chicken back in and pour the thin sauce over it. When it be done, (8 minutes) the sauce have thicken again and coat the chicken nicely, without add any more cornstarch. It will be a repeat. Looking forward to cold leave overs. \\r\\nDorothy As suggested, I use a little more sherry. Delicious, spicy and just enough oomph! We really love the sauce for this chicken. I just have a bite of trouble get the chicken to cook properly accord to the directions. I didn\\'t have any trouble with the consistency of the the sauce with the amount of sherry call for - I think it be because I leave the skin on. Wonderful, thanks.  Took derf\\'s suggestion for add more sherry.  Added a layer of thinly slice yellow bell pepper for the last 6 minutes, which complement the rest of the recipe, and add a vegetable component.  \\r\\n\\r\\nFor the next time, I\\'ll probably add some raisin a well. Yum.\\r\\n Delicious and very flavorable. To cut back on fat I remove the skin.\\r\\nThanks Tebo! Very, very good.  Family like this, will make again.  Thanks! A very tasty, easy to make meal use common ingredient to be find in the pantry. How much easy could one want. And the microwave doesn\\'t heat up the house. My sauce be congealed, too, at the 6 minute mark, but a little more wine and a quick mix make thing right. I find I be out of cayenne pepper, so the same amount of chili powder worked. Thanks for post such a keeper, Tebo. jim WOW! This be fantastic. I can\\'t believe it take me 5 minute to make and 12 minute to cook (in the microwave!!!) and it\\'s SO incredibly delicious! WOW. I find it quite salty (not in an overly salty, bad way)...so whatever you do, DO NOT add salt....the recipe doesn\\'t need it! very easy to make! at the first 6 mins,it congealed, but I ignore it.  Then continue with the next 6 mins, and voila, the sauce didn\\'t congeal anymore! Didn\\'t put the cayenne pepper btw.  I just heat it another extra 6 mins, just to be sure though I think the min you give be fine a it is.  Thanks! The garlic pop wi ththis dish.  And to prepare it all in one dish and only use the microwave.  Those be all of our family flavors.  I do skin the thighs. Cut the fat dowm.  bone side up for part of the cooking, then turn over and sprinkle with cayanne, Perfic. Paprika make the color nice and finish it off.(secret)we salt&pepper the skin an fry them crisp, no oil nessary, addsome garlic powder.  very tasty and crunchy for a side.  The meal be great with white rice and broccoli..Very good Fast, Easy and Great Tasting.  I have two teenage boy and thier friend to fee so I double the recipe, hop to have some leftover for the next day at work...didn\\'t happen, take about 5 minute and it be all gone! I make this last night for dinner and everyone love it. I do add a little extra sherry after read the other review and it be perfect. It doesn\\'t get any easy than this. I also only use 1/4 tsp. of cayenne, we be whimps. I will be make this again thank for such an easy dinner idea. This be just what I be look for tonight!  I want something quick that wouldn\\'t heat up the house.  The kid eat it up and there be no leftovers.  Thank you for the wonderful recipe! These be very good!  Love the spiciness of the thigh and moist-moist-moist from the MICROWAVE! Hello! I add this to my Faves!  BTW, I do only use just one pkg (the 1.8 lb pkg.) of Tyson boneless skinless thighs. Oh, and the additional sauce spoon over the top be out of this world! Thanks, Tebo, for a great recipe.  The store I use be have a sale on skinless chicken thigh and we purchase 5 lbs, so use the oven. Rolled the thigh in the soy mixture, then bake for 15 minute @ 375*F, then turn over and use the rest of the soy mixture and bake another 15 minutes.  Loved the crispiness the oven give it.  Will definitely use again, maybe the next time in the microwave. Very tasty! I\\'m not real fond of meat cook in the microwave, but I like the recipe ingredients,  so I bake them in the oven. The sauce adhere nicely to the chicken pieces. :) I didn\\'t have high expectation for a microwave recipe but this be SO delicious, there be no leftover whatsoever, and it be SO easy! I only do this recipe because i be look for one use ingredient I have on hand. To my surprise it turn out really good! If you be in a pinch for time TRY THIS! & it be great with white rice and broccoli! I use this recipe except for the sherry. Cabernet work well for u instead. Very tasty. This recipe be great!  Yesterday I work in the yard all day and early in the morning have take the boneless chicken thigh out of the freezer.  I need something simple and easy to prepare, and I do not want to go to the grocery store for ingredients.  This be the perfect recipe.  I serve it with my Rice Pilaf, which I prepare in the microwave, and broccoli. This be super easy and super delicious!  My DH and I enjoy it very much. We have leftover for tonight.  I follow AuntSana\\'s suggestion and cook the thigh in the oven accord to her directions.  Thanks Tebo for this wonder recipe and AuntSana for your suggestion! I actually use all but the Paprika (sprinkled over chicken in oven) for a marinade (30 min) and bake in the oven ~ just my preference.  This be AWESOME!  I turn the piece once & sprinkle again w/the Paprika.  My honeybunny go back for more sauce to ladel over chicken, it be that good... very good and super easy.  I also do not really like to cook meat in the microwave.  This be very tasty in the microwave and super fast for a quick dinner.  I just make noodles, apple sauce and the chicken thigh diablo with a salad and it be a meal my husband like and would definitely like again.  Thank you fpr the excellent recipe. I come home need to do something quick with some boneless chicken thighs, and I stumble on this recipe.  I follow the recipe faithfully and it turn out great.  What\\'s even good be that you probably have most of the ingredient need already on hand.  Thanks for this gem! Excellent!  BOTH my son and husband love this chicken -- great job and THANKS! Maybe my microwave be more powerful, but after cook on high for 6 minutes, I just have a few \"clumps\" of sauce left.  Had I cook it for another 6 minute at high, I would have have chicken jerky.  What be leave of the sauce be a tad bitter. This taste good, but I don\\'t cook with the microwave, so I use the oven instead. It didn\\'t taste spicy to us, so I\\'ll add more cayenne pepper next time. We have make this chicken many, many times, there be a couple of thing I would recommend. First only use skinless, boneless thighs, we try it both way and find S/B way the best each time. Secondly if you be have your sauce too thick follow the first 6 minute it be because the amount of cornstarch will always thicken a sauce. I cut it in half every time regardless of how many piece cooked. This way no need to ever have to add extra sherry. Rick m.',\n",
       " \" This cake be just fantastic! I do use almond flour that I keep in my freezer, and use Greek full-fat yogurt, I can't tell you how much we love this cake, it be almost half gone! This will go into my cake favorites, thank Ev!...Kitten:) While the cake taste good, the consistency didn't seem right.  It could be my fault since I be expect it to be like a cake from our local greek restaurant.  It's hard to describe the texture, but the recipe come out more moist and not so much cake. Got to the end of the recipe when I realize I didn&#039;t add the butter because it wasn&#039;t state in the direction when to add it....unless you use an entire stick of butter to oil the pan? This wasn&#039;t make clear, so I leave the butter out. It&#039;s bake right now; I really hope it turn out well. The batter pre-merengue be very soupy so I add more almond flour to thicken it up (about anot her 3/4 cup). It seem odd to add the merengue when it be already light, but I do anyway. Also, the &quot;syrup&quot; isn&#039;t thick like a syrup should be. It&#039;s more of a juice, and that be again with add more honey to help thicken it. Eh, I feel like this recipe wasn&#039;t test enough before post it...anyway, I&#039;ll post an update when it&#039;s do cooking. I don&#039;t have much hope at this point...maybe I&#039;ll be surprised...\",\n",

I use the can tomato with green chili already added, so I do leave off the jalapeno.  I be afraid that the jalapeno would make it too hot!!!  Can\\'t imagine this be any better.  Served with corn chips. Ok yeah, this be really good.  My husband isn\\'t home from work yet, hopefully there will be some leave for him to try.  I can already tell though that he\\'ll want a bowl of this in the fridge at all times.  I use a can of tomato with dice chili  AND a jalapeno and dry cumin and cilantro.  Reeealllly good stuff!! This be one of those recipe where I really wish there be more then 5 star available.  Mostly I stick to the recipe except I use lovely organic green onion from the farmer\\'s market.  They be red, but I also use some of the green tops.  My lime must have be extra juicy because, use my new little hand hold juicer that I just love, I get more then 3 tbs. of lime juice.  I only use 2 tbsp., though.  I do use 3 tbsp. of organic cilantro also buy at the farmer\\'s market.  It be the best cilantro I have ever have the pleasure of try and I know it add a wonderful dimension to this dish.  I put it all together and then put it in the fridge while I prepped my other dishes.  Then I serve it over top of bake tilapia which be a wonderful contrast to the fish.  The rest we eat with homemade bake tortilla chips.  Really spectacular dish.  The proportion be exactly right.  Thanks Toni!   I can only say this...\\r\\nMy husband exact word were... if I know you could make salsa I would have ask for this year ago...\\r\\nI use fresh ingredient and it be so great.. don\\'t know how it be with can stuff but with garden stuff it be a truly great salsa-thanks This be delicious!  I didn\\'t have enough cilantro, add a bite more cumin, salt & pepper, but it still be very good.  Even my husband who doesn\\'t like corn in his salsa rave about it. This be terrific!  Didn\\'t make it the quick and easy way though, since it\\'s the middle of farmer\\'s market season and I have access to the ripe Jersey tomato and sweet Jersey corn, which I oven roasted.  No doubt that helped.  Otherwise my lime be not juicy enough but luckily I have an extra half one leave over in the refrigerator.  I serve with blue and yellow \"Guiltless Gourmet\" bake tortilla chips.  A crowd-pleaser for sure. I be low on tomato and use a full can of corn and beans. I love lime juice in my salsa`s. Thanks for a yummy salsa! I love mexican food especially salsa and chips. We didnt have freeze corn so I use can corn and it be in the refrigerator all day. Now this will be my favorite salsa. Wonderful, easy salsa!  This be my first attempt at homemade and it turn out to be fantastic! I double the recipe and use 1 whole can of corn and black beans.  I would suggest make sure your brand of black bean be firm-mine be a little too soft.  My family LOVED it.  Thanks!! Good salsa! For tomatoes, I use 1/2 can of dice tomato and some leave over tomato salsa. Even so, I be add lime juice, salt and hotnes to the recipe. Our taste bud must be gone. I have make this recipe so many time since I first find it and it be a hit everytime!  It can be serve a a salad, a salsa, a salad topping, burrito topping, or any other way you like. Used a a top for burritos, leave over be use for dip, excellent. I think this be great stuff! I LOVE corn and black bean salsa, especially with blue corn tortilla chips. I\\'m glad to now be able to make my own so I can have this healthy snack more often! I leave out the red onion, jalepeno and cilantro because I don\\'t like red onion and jalepeno and didn\\'t have cilantro on hand. Thanks for an easy recipe for a great snack!! Loved this! The cumin and lime give it a tangy smokey flavor while it get a great texture from the bean and corn. This would be great for a party! Thanks Toni! I\\'ll add my 5 start to this great recipe.  The flavor be perfect.  Texture be perfect.  What more could you ask for.  I make a direct except I use dry cilantro flake since I didn\\'t have the fresh and add a little more of the black bean since I love them.  Thanks Toni for a keeper. What\\'s not to love about this beyond delightful, easy a feezy to prepare, and healthy too, black bean and corn salsa. Oh if life could be a wonderful a this. The color be so vibrant and taste so smooth together just beg you to grab a spoon and eat it directly out of the bowl you mix it in. I have everything on hand, and I didn\\'t even realize it. I follow this exactly a write except a couple of cucumber jump ship from the salad in the fridge and nestle their way into the salsa. Perfect combination of flavors, beautiful eye appeal and good for your tummy too! Thanks for this great salsa and will make this often this summer, Toni! Made for just the heck of it, May 2008, Very fresh!  I make this twice in one day because it be gobble up so quickly.  The first time, I make it a written.  The second time, I be out of can dice tomato so I dice up 4 fresh Roma tomatoes.  I also add a couple dash of hot sauce to kick it up.  Great salsa! This stuff be DELICIOUS!! I\\'ve have it a salsa, but I also use it to make crab quesadillas. YUM! YUM!  Quick, easy, and delicious!  Thanks!  (I use can Mexicorn instead of Frozen Corn.) My neighbor make this for part of a post-surgery dinner she bring over.  It be SO yummy! She make a few changes: cherry tomato instead of canned, roast corn on the cob for the corn, and roast bell peppers.  She also use a splash of Chinese vinegar (rice?) which give a slight hint of sweetness.  I could eat this a a main dish every night! This be VERY yummy! I double the recipe and take it to a fundraise hoedown and get a LOT of compliment on it. I make it a post but add some chop cilantro (because I love the stuff!). Thanks for post this- it\\'s a definite keeper! I have be devour this stuff since I make it for a party last week. What a simple and flavorful salsa! I add 2 jalepnos to mine, some red pepper flakes, and a little habenero sauce...yes, I have a death wish.... and I use dry cilantro because it be all I have on hand and a little more cumin. Thank you for this recipe! Wow this be really good. Everyone have different taste and for me I love saute onions. So I do do that and I add a little garlic. \\nI serve it cold and chicken sandwiches. Later I blend it and we use it for a dip. Fantastic! I absolutely love this recipe and it\\'s versatility! I make the first batch exactly a specified, second batch (after the first go so fast) with mainly can good and add jalapenos, and the last batch a specify but w/ fresh jalapenos, cayenne pepper, salt and pepper and chili sauce. I blame the guy here for the last one b/c they say it need to be spicier! I think the first batch taste the best for someone who doesn\\'t like the spice to overpower the dish. The guy like the spice up version the best. Through all 3 version though, it get eat very quickly, to the last drop! I will definitely be make this next party I have. It be a complete hit! Very good salsa. I find that it improve a lot over time. Seemed to peak around the 3rd day in the fridge. \\r\\n\\r\\nStill think it need a little something, so I add some salt, pepper and a little chipotle seasoning.\\r\\n\\r\\nOverall an extremely good base. Yum!  So good.  I make this for a BBQ and it all went.  The first batch I make I take the seed out of the jalapeno and it be quite mild - so second batch I make it a specify plus add some salt and the people who like spicy salsa really like this version. Fresh, healthy, and easy.  This be a great recipe that I make often now and usually double.  I use fresh tomato instead of the canned, add lot of cilantro just because I like it, and almost double the corn.<br/><br/>I agree with someone\\'s post that the flavor peak around day 3.  For those who be sensitive to spicy foods, you may want to reserve the jalapeño seed and add to taste in the end...although I don\\'t find this salsa particularly spicy.<br/><br/>I scoop it out with tortilla chip or arrange a plate of tortilla chip and shred cheese pop it into the oven to melt and then pour the salsa over it.  Easy.<br/><br/>Thanks very much for sharing. I be look for recipe to use the cilantro that\\'s grow so well in my herb garden. I have just about everything I need in my pantry to try this so I did! Wonderful! As my husband said, \"this be TOO good!\" I have a can of dice tomato with jalapeno so I use that. I do not have a red onion but I do have shallot so I dice a large shallot. I use a little more corn & bean than the recipe specified; and about 1/2 tsp kosher salt. This will become a summer staple in my house! I double this recipe for a carry in, and add about 1/2 teaspoon of salt,  an entire 15 oz can of black bean and 16 oz bag of freeze corn.   Absolutely delicious! Very easy but delicious!  I use a can of dice tomato with chilies and omit the jalapenos.  It have a perfect amount of bite for u but be a bite spicy for the kids.  Next time I\\'d drain some of the juice from the tomatoes, since it be slightly too watery.  Served it a a side dish with fish tacos. I&#039;ve make this quite a few time and now my kid be request it for our Christmas Eve &#039;Mexican Nibbles Feast&#039; so I think I should do a review!  Needless to say, this be well-loved by my family and it couldn&#039;t be easier.  The basic recipe be delicious a it be but you can adjust the heat and season easily, accord to your taste.  Love it!  Thanks Toni :)',\n",
       " ' Rita this be awesome!  I use some on a couple of grill steak and put it on top a I turn them, the smell and the flavor be incredible.  The leftover steak I use in a salad and it be jsut a good that way.  I have the rest in the freezer and Im sure will find many many many way to use this over and over!  Thanks Rita!',\n",
       " ' I make this with halve tin apricots, and leave them like that so they poke up like egg yolk through the batter. I also have no cognac, so use an orange liqueur which be good. Using the halve can apricots, I have this mix and in the oven in 5 minute. that\\'s a plus, so be the fact it be quite low in fat-I also use a low fat milk. Really tasty and so simple!  We use fresh apricot that have be sit around, not ripen properly for some reason.  This be perfect for them.  I add an extra 1/2 tb sugar, because I be worry that they would be tart.  I follow the recipe exactly, use organic whole milk and a lovely 30 year old cognac.  This have a wonderful light but rich flavor.  BF and I polish this off quickly between us, so I would agree with the 2 serve size, although I think you could probably stretch this far if you serve with, say, ice cream, on the side.  I bake this in a deep-dish 9\" pie pan, but the clafouti be rather thin in the end.  The flavor in this be terrific- it taste so rich, although it be not bad for you at all!  Thank you for posting- this be delicious! I make this this past summer and it be really good. (I wasn\\'t a member then so I didn\\'t review it then). I didn\\'t have cognac, so I think I use about a teaspoon of vanilla extract instead. The batter be just sweet enough to go with the sweet-tartness of the apricots, and this taste really light and fresh and perfect for summer. Ooh. this be so good!  I\\'ve often wonder what a clafouti  is, and now I know -- it\\'s great.  A wonderful summer dessert.   And very easy to make! Next time I will try it with cherry a you suggest in another thread.  And maybe some soft ice cream on the side. Otherwise I wouldn\\'t change a thing.  Thanks so much for share this recipe, Evelyn/Athens. Very good!  I use fresh apricot from the farmer\\'s market.  I substitute OJ, vanilla and a bite of almond extract for the cognac.  Wonderful serve warm with the powder sugar.  Also good with vanilla ice cream.  Also, this be very quick to whip and bake.  Thanks for suggest this, evelyn!  I will make this again. Ooh yum!  I be expect the clafouti part to be a bite more spongey, but it be more like a custard.  This be great!  Nice and simple, I sub almond extract and an extra Tb of milk for the cognac, and I also use can apricot for economy\\'s sake.  Delish!  I will definitely make this again. Made just a recipe call for..even go and buy cognac..and have a glass while it baked..lol..this be super..will make again..Thanks We have an abundance of peach right now, so I use those instead of apricots.   Very flavorful!  The custard wasn\\'t quite what I be expecting, but tasty none-the-less.    We have ours with a small scoop of vanilla ice cream.  Very nice!',\n",
       " ' This recipe be \"OK.\"  A lot of cheese with very little cheese flavor.  Will not be make this again.    We be big fan of this recipe. It be very quick to throw together, the aroma be fantastic, and it make a tasty, fill meal. The only quibble I have be that the hash brown don\\'t really form a crust; really, this be more of a potato/cheese casserole than a pie. Next time I may prebake the potatoes, maybe even under the broiler, so that they crisp up a bite or form a crust. Still, this be a good, flavorful recipe. Thanks!',\n",

Also use 1tsp sambal oelek instead of chili flakes.  Fabulous flavour that we both enjoyed.  Served with stirfried vegies & rice for a great, easy meal.  Made for Aus/NZ Recipe Swap August 2008. This be quick and easy!  I have sit in the fridge a pack of chicken breast, heap of spring onion and sit in my pantry be the rest of the ingredients.

Served it with crusty bread.  Thank you The Flying Chef Fast & easy to make.  Served with rice and crusty garlic bread.  Enjoyed by all.  Another keeper :)\\r\\nMade for Aus/NZ swap February 2010 I love chicken satay and I'm always look for a faster, easy recipe. I haven't try this one yet, but one thing have me confused. The photo (in fact the very definition of &quot;chicken satay&quot;) involve skewer piece of chicken. The direction make no reference to skewer at any stage. In fact, use of a wok for both stag of fry preclude use of skewer (unless the wok be very large or the skewer be very short !) I would love to make this but see no instruction for cook on skewer or grilling. Is the photo misplaced? Obviously the chicken in the photo be grilled, yet the recipe call for pan/wok stir fried. I too would prefer American measurements. Sounds good I'll try it but I'll tweak it my way I think chicken satay be always serve with a peanut sauce -- see no recipe for that sauce in this recipe. Also confuse about cook method -- no grill instruction What a joke! This be chicken satay? Think again, maybe you want to say fry chicken or.... Do not post the wrong stuff. Like somebody else said: chicken satay be marinate chicken, grilled, serve with peanut sauce and cucumber relish. Satay sauce be make not store bought. Where do you get it!!! Ha, ha! This recipe and direction make NO SENSE. I be an advance cook and nothing match up..picture, how to serve, etc. Is this one an April Fool's joke? Check out Michael Symon's satay roast chicken recipe on The Chew. I would love to make this but this recipe make no sense at all. We be in America, please use standard American measurements. And be it a stir fry a direction say or grill skewer a picture show. This be a mess!!!!! I would like to make this dish, but a another senior citizen I too be unable to translate the measurements, plus how many cook really measure out 1 1/16c of a liquid? Guess i’ll pass.\",\n",

I have make an almost identical cake like this for year (my mother do too) but always use cake flour (sifted before measuring) . You need to add about 2 tbls. more.  It give (I feel) a good consistency.  A previous reviewer suggest not grease the side of the pan NEVER nor should the bottom be greased.  The cake be turn upside down to cool completely and then ease out of the pan. This also help avoid any sink in the middle.   It be a lovely versatile recipe and lend itself to many fillings.  Have also use it a a base for fruit.   Realize it be much more work than a cake mix but oh my what a difference.\",\n",

The lovely pink shade also make it perfect for a spring buffet.  Thank you so much for share this - I will make it often (it's already be request for future gatherings).  I might even consider a sprinkle of chipotle powder for just a tad more heat.  Wonderful! This be so delicious Picholine. I really enjoy this tasty dip, I love the addition of the green onions.

Thank you so much for share this recipe, Laudee. My local grocery recently start carry extra lean grind pork, so that start me on a sausage quest. This be the one I like the best. It taste very different from the Bob Evans sausage, which be just full of every bad thing that I try to avoid eating. I use one pound of 90% lean pork, and make 16 good size patty that come out to 45 calorie each. When make your patties, beware, lean pork do not shrink up like the fatty stuff.\\r\\nP.S. Speaking of avoid bad things, I cut the salt in half and it be fine.  Also, if you don't have a 1/4 tb measure for the white pepper, use a teaspoon just a little short of level. I happen on a sale on grind pork so I decide to make some sausage. I didn't want Italian sausage, bratwurst, or country sausage becuase I have all of them in the freezer.

Exactly the flavor we be look for.  We add a bite of marjoram and 10 small hot peppers.  We leave out the salt and add salt directly to the meat at the end (about .5 teaspoon per pound).  We need far more spice than call for here: about 1.5 tablespoon per pound grind pork (mixture WITHOUT salt). I think this be good.  DH think it be alright.  I think the nutmeg be a little odd. This be great.  I be want some sausage for biscuit and gravy when I stumble across this one.

I use a whole venison loin and add a can of mushroom and a beef bouillion cube and a lipton onion/mushrooms soup mix. next time I think I will add even more water since by the 3 hour mark it have greatly reduced. Instead of slice onion I use a mince onion (that be what I have in the fridge). Thanks so much we have it with mash potato and it be wonderful! Looking forward to the next itme I get to make it! Great dinner!!  The venison roast we have be about 2.5 pounds, so a little smaller, but we use the crockpot, cook for 8 hour on low and the meat be so tender.  The man be in heaven.  We serve it with cheddar mash potato and that be perfect. I think I'll add mushroom next time and since the roast be small, le water.  Barb, you get a winner here!! Very tasty and so tender. Did it in the crockpot.I marinate it 1 day in red wine and crush garlic,put it in the pot at 8.30 in the morning and it be do by 4.30. I will make it again.\",\n",
       " \" Yummy pancakes! I adore pancake with pecan in them and these do not disappoint! They come out fluffy and light with a great flavor! Made for ZWT 3. Fluffy and delicious with a little crunch from the pecans. I have mine with butter and syrup and some pecan on top, but they would pair with almost anything.  Any sort of fruit would be delicious. You've get a real winner here Annacia!  Thank you for share your recipe! Takes a bite more time to prepare than regular pancake but it's worth it :P    I do exactly the same and mium it's so good :P  Thanks :) Delicious pancakes!  I grind my pecan very fine and the flavor fill the whole pancake without be too crunchy.  The pancake be nice and fluffy too.  These taste like a wonderful warm sticky bun - great breakfast treat - thank for sharing! Great pancakes! I make them exactly a the recipe states...next time I might grind the pecan up small, just because our kid would like a little le crunch. I add fresh blueberry to a few of them and that be a nice touch. Thanks for a wonderful recipe! These be great and a nice change from regular pancakes.  Mine weren't real fluffy, but it could have be because I make them gluten free and the result aren't always the same a regular flour.  Regardless of this they be good.  Will try them again with a different gluten free flour mix ~ something that be a little light than what I used.  Thanks for post this Annacia.  Made for Went to Market Tag. Wonderful pancake Annacia.  I really enjoy this tasty treat.\\r\\nThe pancake be light, fluffy and tender.  I love the crunch from the pecans. I serve mine with butter and pure maple syrup.  I have place this treasure in my keeper box.  Thanks for sharing. :) Outstanding and easy to make! One little adjustment .. I go down to 1/4 teaspoon salt, other than that Wonderful pancakes.  Made for a great breakfast, nice, easy, and fluffy.  I top them with some butter pecan syrup that I pick up at the local orchard.  Great recipe.  Made for Zaar`Stars. wow these be good ,i do have to add a little more milk cause my batter be too thick  but they be fluffy and have great flavor and i didnt use any salt .didnt need it . As with all of Annacia&#039;s recipe this be a winner.  Light, fluffy and easy to make.  Love pecan pancake and this one have it all.  Just the right touch of sweetness with the brown sugar.  I do make one change - replace half the milk with club soda -  I often do this to increase the fluffiness of the pancake and it work well here. I make these a written, with my first test cake I think they be a bite bland so add a little cinnamon. Flavor-wise they be ok but what move them from  3 star (good) to 2  be the texture. No matter how I adjust the heat I couldn&#039;t get them to cook all the way through - and even then the outside get over cooked. DH eat them but I couldn&#039;t :(  &lt;br/&gt;( I frequently make a fluffy type pancake so this be in my skill set) Made for Culinary Quest Southern US for the Cruisin&#039; Culinary Queens These be wonderful! They be only slightly hard to cook, but only because I don't see the bubble that you normally see when you cook pancakes. So I test the first one for doneness and then time the rest accordingly. They be super thick and have a lot of flavor. I've make several times, these will be our go-to weekend treat! Horrible! My Mom want pecan pancakes, and I be unfortunate enough to choose this recipe. I follow the direction to a T, and if you like dry, heavy pancake a oppose to “light and fluffy”, this be it. Equal amount of flour and milk/buttermilk, so of course they be go to taste like wallpaper paste. Waste of time, money, and effort, and listen to Mom complain be no fun either.\",\n",
       " ' SO GOOD!!!! I make them into ball and fry them, a well a cut the recipe in half and get 15 golf ball size treats. Will be make much more often!!! So true........very addicting.  I roll our bunuelos into rope (forming circles) and sprinkle with cinnamon and sugar.  A very nice brunch idea.  Thanks, again, Wildflour, for another tasty recipe. My husband and I make these over the weekend. They be perfect (he\\'s Hispanic...and the offical \"mexican food\" authenticity taster :) Thank you! I never think of do BuÃ±uelos in a ball (they taste like Churros, so my Hubby said)...lol My family love these. I have a recipe for BuÃ±uelos, which I will post. Mine have white wine in it and other ingredients. Thanks for the recipe. My daughter enjoy put them into balls. Made these for a dinner party and a novelty for the guests.  Easy to make and true to the ingredients/recipe. These be an amaze and easy to make treat. Don\\'t believe me? I, a 15 year old highschool student and my friend, also a 15 year old make them perfectly in about 25 minutes. (Ironically for a spanish project) I have to make a spanish recipe for my spanish class and this be a great recipe. It be very delicious and not that time consuming. The only thing I have a hard time with be how messy it was. I spend a much time clean a I do prepping and cooking. But overall it be a quick and a great taste recipe. Well, I don&#039;t know what I do wrong. I follow the direction perfectly and have a lot of fun make them, but they turn out horrible. I expect something like an elephant ear or fluffy doughnut almost, instead I get little biscuits. I&#039;m not sure what I should&#039;ve add more or le of, but they be quite the disappointment. The inside taste undo and the outside be like a biscuit. Maybe my oil be too hot? Although, the stave be only on 2/5. &lt;br/&gt;I remember my mom would make these and I love them. If anyone could tell me what I may have do wrong, I greatly appreciate it. Like I said, these make correctly be amaze from what I remember. For some reason mine just didn&#039;t turn out at all. :/ Real bunuelos do not have eggs, milk and be make with Crisco not butter. The taste be clean and they come out crispy and golden not dark. the recipe be just like make tortilla but it have more bake powder to make them fluffy. What flour plain or self raise x this be golly good i really enjoy the amount of cinnamon use but it be to dry for my need They be really good there be a couple of minor word issue that throw u off when make the mix but that be mostly our bad. 4/5 I absolutely ruin them lol I make for the first time today. I cook till quite a bite past golden brown but they be mostly raw inside. Again....how long do one deep fry these guys? Would love to try again We make them in a flat 16 inch circle. Added brush butter before sugar mixture. Dip in syrup. Wow.',\n",
       " \" My only problem with this recipe be that I have to cook for twice a long a the recipe specify in order to get to a consistency I'm use to for a chutney. I use a whole jalapeno but remove most of the seeds. Otherwise I follow the recipe exactly (I do use the optional cardamom). The long cook time be definitely worth it though a the flavor be quite good! I might reduce the amount of balsamic next time but otherwise it's good as-is. Oh, this also yield close to 3.5 cup rather than two. I mix some of this with cream cheese and use it with some ham to make a sandwich; the rest will probably be freeze until I figure out what to use it for LOL Thanks for the recipe! It be rhubarb season and I have some leftover from my garden, so I think I would make up this chutney.  It have a good blend of sweet, tartness and kick from the ginger/jalapeno.  I process this chutney into 6 half pint jar and give them away a gifts.  I would do this recipe again.  Thanks for the contribution\",\n",

It\\'s very tropical taste and you can\\'t even taste the rum - so be careful - it\\'s so good, you\\'ll keep drink it and before you know it - BOOM!  It instant buzz! Made it for my Dad`s B-day Party!Makes a full punch ball so make sure you have a crowd to serve!\\r\\nGood Stuff! WOW!!! Made this when have friend over. So similar to a pina colada except you can\\'t taste the rum, I think the cherry and pineapple chunk \"absorb\" it. Will be make this again! Have be make this rum slush for year and find that the big Tupperware Thatsa Bowl be just the perfect size for this recipe and the freezer, and it\\'s great to be able to cover and store the leftover if any. First saw this a a rum punch use Coco Lopez, le freeze but with a whole gallon of freeze orange sherbert cut in chunk and float in the punch.  Over time we freeze it more, add a can of fruit cocktail on occasion, try diet 7-up a a low calorie version, etc.  Eventually we learn to leave out the rum entirely so that the child a well a anyone on medication could enjoy it too.  Now we leave room all summer in the freezer so we be never without this treat during the hot months. For some reason this do not turn out for me; it have a bitter taste and my husband be mad at me for waste his good rum.  We throw the whole batch out. Omg omg omg!!

       " ' Oh,Wow,these be so good.Finger lick good. Oh very good!!! My family\\'s only complaint be ....I didn\\'t make enough!!!!! Jessica, I have to confess that I cheated... we be out at an afternoon B\\'day party and be to bring guest home with us... so I throw everything into the crockpot (NO boiling, just meat and sauce) and leave it on for the 5 hour that we be away... It be good time come home, we be starve for something savoury to nibble a the only thing to eat at the party be overly cream cakes, but didn\\'t want anything too fussy, so this with a litte salad and chicken on stick go down a treat. I didn\\'t make too muchsince this be an experiment and my small amount be *just* begin to get too dark after 5 hours, and since the meat be fall off the bone, I grab the salad and next minute it be all go ! I will play around with the recipe just a little a \"more garlic\" be mutter by more than one full mouth, but your recipe be a hit and it will be a regular feature in our house from now on. Please see my rat system: a wonderful 5 stars:) Thanks ! I agree, \"finger-licking\" good!  And so easy to combine the sauce ingredients.  The garlic and ginger flavor really come through.  I use baby back rib and my only complaint be that I want more!  Thanks for a recipe I will be use often. Very tasty, the sause be outstanding. I use pork spare rib instead of beef and double amount of garlic. Thanks, it be great. I\\'m plan to make it again next week. Deliscious !!!  I add more garlic and 1/4 t Chinese 5 spice powder and it be absolutely wonderful !!!! These be great.  I use freeze rib and subsequently boil the rib for too long; I think 2 hour would have be sufficient.  I didn\\'t have chili sauce, so I just use a little extra catsup and some cayenne to spice it up a little.  Yum. :-) Delish! Made these last night and DH and I enjoy them very much.  The only ingredent I have to purchase be the Hoisin sauce.  We raise our first pig last year and I have two package of ribs.  I will use this for the second pack and probably for some of the shoulder steak a well.  It be finger lick good.  Thanks for post a very easy and tasty recipe, Leslie This be really good!!!  Definately a hit with the family :)  Thanks. This be just great! My family love the spicy asian flavor. We will definetally make again. We felt like we have go out to dinner! i swap in a little filipino jufran banana hot sauce instead of half of the ketchup and skip the sherry. boil the rib on fairly low heat for 4+ hour due to not come home a soon a i expected. the rib turn out so great i even mention them in my blog (although it\\'s not at all about cooking).  I really like this recipe, it be very tender and tasty.  Instead of boil the rib on the stovetop, I let them sit in the crockpot all afternoon in water, season and a little vinegar (to help tenderize).  The rest of the recipe I follow exactly (except that I have to omit the sherry, a I do not have any on hand).  The rib be finger-licking good! Thanks! These be inhaled.  I didn\\'t want to fuss over these, so I do a another reviewer and cook them in the crockpot over low for about 6 hours.  They be literally \"fall off the bone\".  AND have amaze flavor.  I didn\\'t have any dry sherry but that be the only difference in ingredient - everything else be just right.  Everyone at gamenight think I be some great cook, but I just follow great recipe like these that make me look really good.  Thank you for share this.  I will make these over and over. Used this for a pork roast and it go over good than almost anything I\\'ve make before!! OMG this be great!!!!!!! Served with rice. This be truly yummy and a an asian it sure beat all the other rib I have ever eated. So thank for sharing....my kid think I be an awesome cook now... Awesome ribs!  I didn\\'t boil them but basically steam them in a cover broil pan with water at 325 for about 2 1/5 hour then slather them with the sauce and broil for about 20 minute to make them crispy (pouring out the water first).  They be perfect and the sauce be excellent.  A nice change from standard BBQ ribs.  Thanks for sharing! Great recipe! I follow all the step and replace only the fresh ginger with a tablespoon of ginger powder and it still work great. This be quite an authentic Chinese spare rib recipe. My one problem be that after the baking, the rib be a little dry. So, I guess I will have to reduce the bake time a little next time. Will definitely be use this recipe again. Thanks! I follow the instruction for the sauce verbatim. This have get to be the bad taste sauce I have ever tasted.  It do not even taste like a Chinese sauce. I have have Chinese Spareribs many time in restaurant and this recipe do not even come close. I try add the extra Hoisin and Honey like you suggest and the taste get worse.  Sorry, but I want to give you an honest review. Wonderful recipe - thank for sharing, I combine all ingredient and use them a a marinade then cook in the marinade on a low heat at 120c for 2 hour cover in foil.\\nTo finish sizzle on the bbq and keep baste with the cook marinade - delicious pork rib should NEVER touch water.',\n",

Another optional ingredient my dear friend sometimes add be cooked, shred beet which give the soup a lovely pink colour and additional flavour.  (Now I just use can beets.)  Either way, this be a real keeper. Was much good after I chill it several days, and blend it slightly to mix the flavor together (but NOT to puree). I think I would make it again next summer, but I might replace the yogurt with sour cream. Thanks for sharing! Fabulous!! And definitely good the second (and third) day. I use 3 cup of English cuke for this, peeled, seeded, and diced.  I put some of the cucumber with the yogurt and some of the buttermilk in the blender, but leave the rest of the cucumber in chunks.  Wasn't sure what half a bunch of parsley translate to, so I use about 1/4 cup mince of italian parsley.  Added some salt and white pepper.  Made it before lunch to eat at dinner.  I think both the dill and parsley flavor be a bite strong, and I think I might add more cucumber next time.  still overall, a cool and refresh soup.

I just love quinoa and I have mint and parsley grow in the garden. A real zinch to put together this recipe too. The rest time really do make all the difference. Thanks for another great recipe. (I\\'d give you more than 5 star for this recipe if Zaar would allow it!) Perfectly deelicous.  I be look for a recipe with Quinoa and this be IT!\\r\\nGREAT, thank for sharing.  Lolly\\r\\n*I use a bite le oil. Great! I love tabouli and, though it take a couple of bite to get use to a different grain, really enjoy this dish. Am always look for quinoa recipe and this be a nice change. Very fresh and light. Made a great lunch with fresh fruit on the side. Thanks for share the recipe! It\\'s yummy with Inca Red quinoa, too! This recipe be easy to make and be an absolute hit at my beach party.  Everyone keep tell me that the Quinoa Tabouli be perfect for a hot day out in the sun because it be fill and sustaining, but not heavy, and quite cool internally.  It stay fresh for three day cover and refrigerated. delicious and healthy. i follow the recipe exactly but I would add garbanzo bean and fresh avocado next time for fun.  also, i be concern about add the quinoa to the parsley and tomato while it be so hot, but it seem to work just fine. I be now addict to quinoa.  I love the texture and flavor, not to mention the health benefits!  This be something I have never think of and I love it!  I use grape tomato halve and it work wonderfully. Thank you for something unique. Holy yowsa, this be the best non-traditional tabouli I\\'ve ever, ever eaten! Unbelievable!  The quinoa be a great twist on the traditional tabouli texture.  I add chick pea and cucumber to give an additional crunch and double the mint because it be my favorite part of tabouli.  I only let the dish sit for an hour before serve it, and it be still delicious.  Will definitely make this again. I love use quinoa in tabouli!  The best part for our family be that it be gluten-free! Not sure what I do wrong with this, but my tabouli turn out very liquidy. However, my BF and I both love the way this taste (he say he\\'s not a fan of tabouli) so I give it 5 stars. The quinoa be definitely dry after cooking, and though I play around a bite with the amount (dictated by the fact that I only have 3/4 cup quinoa left), that still didn\\'t explain why it have excess liquid (I reduce the oil by a lot, use 1/3 cup lemon juice and use 2 medium tomatoes). Unfortunately I could not find fresh mint in the store when I make this so I substitute dry (2 teaspoons). It be still good, thank Toni! I use buckwheat instead of quinoa. It cook up in about 20 minutes. Turned out very nice. Btw: I would not recommend use kasha which be the toast version of buckwheat a it be strong tasting. \\n\\nThe only hard part be process the parsley. I separate off most of the stems, discard the big one and finely chop the small stems. It should also be note that parsley be best soak and spin in a salad spinner to clean it properly. I\\'ve make this a few time and really like it. Except for the first time, I\\'ve reduce the olive oil to 1/4 cup and keep forget to reduce the lemon by a bit. However, it\\'s still a really nice recipe a be and taste healthy and fresh. I absolutely love everything about this salad, and will make it often in the come months. It\\'s so refresh and delicious!  It go great with my main course, Recipe #141468, and Recipe #356015.  Thanks for share it with u Toni!  Made for Zaar Stars 4/09  Linda I think this be Fabulous!  Thank you for post such a fresh taste recipe!  I add a little fresh garlic, and 1/2 cucumber, and next time I may add some chickpea a someone else suggested.  I will be make this a a side dish for my daughter\\'s baptism next week!  Thanks again! I be so disappointed! I think this would have LOTS of flavor, but it fell short for me. Maybe I didn\\'t use enough parsley? It be almost TOO lemony. I will continue to play with it though - I love quinoa. I like this quite a bit. It have the right amount of parsley for my taste, and I really like the use of quinoa instead of bulgur (I might actually prefer it now). The only change I will make next time be to use le lemon juice...it be a bite overpowering, I thought. Thanks for share this! This go over pretty good at a company dinner party that we hosted.  I tell them all that we be do \"heart healthy\" and they all want to know about Quinoa. This be very good with quinoa, which be rich in protein. Ultimately, I prefer the bulgar version. excellent! Just couldn\\'t believe how good this was!  Thanks, justcallmetoni! The delicate quinoa make this salad even  lighter! DH think we should have this every week! This be way too lemony for our taste -- until I add more oil. Will make again, but use only 1 lemon, not 2. Everyone love it and find it something new and different! Wonderful now we can eat tabouli again! We be gluten free. This taste fresh and almost exactly like the typical version but it healthier. We like to add a lot more fresh lemon juice than call for. I also throw in a couple pinch of cinnamon a I think Ive hear thats the secret to good tabouli. Make sure to wash the quinoa very well between your finger while rub the grain together. I do not add a much scallion out of preference. I serve this on it\\'s own or I have serve it with Recipe #181865 and Recipe #322921 for a good Lebanese/Palestinian meal. I will make this again. It taste delicious but some people think it be a bite too sour even though I only add 1/4 cup lemon juice--half what be call for. I also only use a tablespoon olive oil, which seem plenty and keep the dish light and fresh-tasting. I would also prefer it with more veggie and le quinoa; next time I make this I think I\\'ll add cucumber and more tomatoes. This be super yummy! The shocker be my kid even like it!! I read everyone\\'s rat on the top 10 Quinoa recipes. I rinse in water for 10 minute (I be not make that mistake) and then toast it. I do everything but the mint, didn\\'t have any on hand, so instead I add some Basil mainly becuz I love it. I would have add some Feta, but I be out of that too. I have try lot of Quinoa recipe lately but I really think I like this one best. Thanks for posting. This be SOOO good! I be try to find something new to try with quinoa and this be perfect. My husband and I love that it be so healthy. Using only fresh ingredient be the only way to make this recipe. We have make this a few time and plan on make it even more! I have quinoa on my shop list but manage to get home without it.  So I use millet instead.  Yummmm!  And it hasn\\'t even sit awhile yet. I absolutely love this recipe! We have no mediterranean or middle eastern cuisine where I live so I must make it myself.  This tabouli be a keeper. This come out great! I make it with red quinoa because they be out of the regular kind at the store. It turn out to be a lot more than I expected; definitely more than 4-6 servings. This be my first time use quinoa in anything.  I use red quinoa instead (all i have in the pantry) and garlic instead of scallion and, wow oh wow, this be fast and amazing!!  I haven\\'t even let it sit in the fridge yet, and i\\'ve already devour a huge serve with some grill chicken on the side!  Absolutely delicious, super fast, super easy and best of all healthy!  5 star all the way! This recipe be nice and refresh and definitely make a lot more that the 4-6 serve stated, and be a great use for quinoa.  Thank you Justcallmetoni for share the recipe. Yummy. I put my tomato in the food processor; even though I take them out with a slot spoon, that make them a bite too juicy, make my tabouli a bite too wet, but it be delicious nonetheless. I didn\\'t add the mint (because my daughter find it on the counter and throw it out, think it be ... weeds?!? LOL). I\\'ll add mint next time. I didn\\'t have time for the overnight flavor marriage, but it be still very good. This be my husband\\'s favorite new dish.  We make it tomato-free to satisfy the picky eater in our family, and it\\'s still delicious.  Be sure to use all the fresh ingredients, a the recipe call for -- try once with freeze & defrost herb and it wasn\\'t nearly a good. This be a hit at our house!  I use dry mint and parsley because I didn\\'t have fresh but follow everything else exactly.  It be light and refresh and be a perfect compliment to fish! YUM!!! Very good, and the only quinoa recipe I could get my kid to eat! The whole family love it, plus it be very healthy-full of protein and veggies! Thanks! I love this. I will be make this instead of bulgar wheat from now on.  Thanks so much for  sharing.  I leave  out the mint but do not really miss it.  I toast the quinoa first use Quinoa-Toasted  from this site. I really like this.  I double the mint and halve the lemon juice.  Thanks for this new version of tabouli! Having grow up lebanese and love most of all the food, I never care for tabouli.  Yet, I know how healthy it be for you to eat all those thing uncooked and I think I would find a recipe that get good ratings.  I be so glad I did!  I have add to the my family lebanese cookbook that have be pas down through the generation and this one will be pas on a well.  We add cucumber, pine nuts, cilantro and garlic.  Thank you again! Excellent! Love the healthy version.  Slowly switch the family to more grain and leguems and this recipe catch my eye.  Will have for dinner tonight with falafel and all the other fixens. This be a good recipe for tabouli.  I cook the quinoa in the rice cooker and it be a bite mushy so when I make it again I will cook the grain in the manner suggested, This be just a expected, which be a taste combination that I love.  For me, the full amount of lemon be delicious.  Since my husband maintain a gluten free diet, I doubt that I will use bulgar in this dish again.  I will definitely make this again. really like this recipe. I do add cucumber and cub whole milk mozzarella. I may toast so pine nut next time. totally rocks! i join food.com just so that i could write a review for this recipe. i love it! everyone i have serve it to love it also!  we really prefer the quinoa over bulgur and like that this recipe do not have cucumbers. i will grow more parsley this year than last just so i can make this more often! I have make this recipe about 20 times. My family, who would never eat tabouli make with bulgur, inhale this. Thank you for a wonderful, delicious recipe. I&#039;ll never make tabouli any other way! This be delicious! Like another reader, I add cucumber and fresh cilantro. I have also read somewhere to roast the quinoa first, which I did. It be excellent. I have add this to my favorites. Yum!  This be mine and my husband&#039;s new favorite summer salad.  I agree with other review that it be delicious hot or cold, with or without garbanzo added.  My kid like it best with garbanzo so that be how we usually eat it.  Thanks Justcallmetoni for the recipe post! This be one of the best quinoa recipe I&#039;ve ever tried. Love the lemon a it make the dish so refreshing. Eat it hot, cold or room temperature!  It&#039;s amaze any way you eat it!!! I like quinoa, I\\'ll have to try this. Add chop cucumber.',\n",

       " \" Super easy and delish! The combo of the sweet & smokey mequite mix with the creamy texture of the sauce and avocado be perfect!!! Will def make this again! This be not only delicious, but the presentation be beautiful.  I'm file this one away for dinner guest because it look so impressive (but be so easy)!  Thanks for posting! I really enjoy this recipe. I've make it twice now. The first time we make sandwich of it and the second time we make a instructed. Both time be delicious.

       " \" I make a slight change to this, I grate all the vegetable and didn't bother to blend it (because my blender break down) It be still very tasty and a bite more chunky.  It taste good the next day.  Thanks for post PanNan.  Made for ZWT7. I make a written, except for cut the potato down to 4 large Yukon Golds.  I think I would cut that down to 2 next time, a this seem more like potato soup instead of pea soup, and be too thick.  I would also eliminate the step use the whole onion, and just chop it and add to the mix, and add the bay leave and cloves.  Seemed like a waste of an onion.  This soup be very tasty, though, and I have never use yellow split pea before.  They seem a little light in flavor than green.  Made for ZWT 7. We enjoy this thick and tasty soup PanNan.  It have so much flavor and be easy to make. We really enjoy the texture of the soup. I do cut down the number of potato after read the review to 5 small and keep everything else the same, stir in leftover ham from off the bone at the end of cooking.  Thank you for share a recipe that I will be make again. Dh already ask me when be we have ham again and not to forget to make this recipe.  High praise indeed, thank you. Made for the Witchin Kitchen ZWT7.\",\n",
       " ' I enjoy the Gumbo but DH and DD do not like it at all.  I should have realize when I make it that they do not like any roux base sauce so the fault be mine, not the recipe.  Therefor, 4 star anyway cause I like it and sometimes you have to just please yourself.   I make this for a New Years Eve party.  I be a huge hit.  I add 1 28oz can chop tomato and some extra low fat low salt chicken broth to thin the consistency.  We all say YaYa. This be a true Louisiana gumbo, many have the misconception that okra go in all gumbos, not so! This be authentic chicken and sausage gumbo, thank for posting!!\\r\\nkit We have this for dinner last night at a friend house; they just move up from New Orleans.  Oh my...ssssoooo YA YA!  All u girl be in the kitchen helping/watching. Had to find the recipe! Thanks so much for post this, it&#039;s a keeper for sure!',\n",

       " \" This be great!  I don't really like turkey that much (once a year for Thanksgiving be enough for me!!) I make a trukey for V-Day because it be take up too much room in the freezer.  Since it be just me and DH there be a ton of leftovers!!  I defrost some for this and luckily it be about 5 cup full!  Made recipe exactly except for the addition of the extra cup of turkey (and up'ed the mayo also).  Will be make this every year to use up the turkey-day leftovers!!  Made for PAC Spring 2008 and glad I did!! Pretty good stuff. It be a bite mild/bland for me, but out of a house full of people (mebbe 16-18) all seem to like it. I just save a lil extra aside for myself that I put some creole season in to satisfy my oddball taste buds. Thanks for posting.\",\n",

       " \" Delicious!  We SO enjoy these tonight and they didn't take anything like 40 minute to cook.  Except for add some mince garlic and add a blend of rosemary and sage to the thyme - all of which I love - I make these exactly to the recipe.  They crisp up beautifully and we enjoy them with Sydney Mike's Recipe #368227.  They'd also be excellent with tzatziki such a Recipe #157176 or with a dollop of Greek yoghurt or sour cream.  Again, thank you for share a super recipe, Sydney Mike.  The sweetness of the carrot add  a wonderful flavour dimension to what be basically traditional latkes.  But so too do your Recipe #368227!  :) I can see myself make these two recipe together - often.  Made for PRMR. Loved these pancake Syd :)  I make a written, except for use brown rice flour in place of the regular flour to suit my gluten-free diet. So easy to make and all cook in around 20 minute from start of prep to end of cook time. I couldn't help myself and serve these with sour lite cream and my favourite Thai sweet chilli sauce. Delicious. Made 12 pancake and serve the four of us........though they be so good, I should have make a double batch! For vegans, egg replacer would work in these pancakes. The carrot and potato be a great combo. Photo also to be post This make a nice light supper with a salad! I halve the recipe more or le and serve with a honey mustard mayo sauce. Thanks! Made for PRMR game. This be one of those wonderful recipe that only few know about! I love it! The sweetness of the carrot match perfectly with thyme.Next time (oh,there'll be a lot of next times) I might bake them in the oven .A great dish for kids. Didn't change a thing,except that I make a double batch.Thanks for sharing. I don't know how I forget to rate this recipe, but here I be remind myself of how good it is, and that I've get to make it again soon. I always seem to have an abundance of carrot that I need to figure out new recipe for, but this will be among the staples. Thyme be just the perfect herb to go with this. The only thing I add be some garlic...because well, garlic make everything better. And some spring onion a well, if I have them handy. These be pretty delicious! I make a write except that I use canola oil instead of the nonstick spray. The thyme give it a great flavor that I think would be suit good for the fall or winter than summertime, and I will definately be make these again when the weather cools. The leftover be tasty, but they do not retain their crispness, so next time I'll make just enough to eat right away. I first have these a a young adult, cook by house mates. Loved them and have cook them, then forget about them and so google the recipe. I make them, or the first 3 by recipe but feel you need to use oil and canola best rather than cook spray. The spay have them soft but the oil crisp them up! Like another person mention maybe some garlic but any other ingredient be by choice but please squeeze out excess juice before mix with flour. Thanks for the recipe and enjoy!\",\n",
       " \" Easy and delish! I opt for chicken broth, dry basil, fresh ginger root and leave the breast whole. Flavored perfectly! Thanks. Wouldn't change a thing here.  These be so easy and just delicious. I do include the pepper flakws which add some zing without make them hot. It be too hot to turn on the broiler for 2 servings, so I cook the chicken on my George Foreman.  With the small strip 2.5 minute be perfect. Thanks Sharon! Looking over the ingredient list, I decide to use Chinese shao xing wine instead of sherry for a more authentic taste. Chicken be so tender and tasty. Preparation be so easy. Thank you for posting. Wouldn't change a thing.  I leave my breast whole and they make for a lovely meal compliment Tisme's Creamy Matchstick Carrots, along with steam green bean &peas and Jewelies Smashed Potatoes.   Thanks for a 'keeper'. :) Fantastic! This chicken be so moist and flavorful, and I love the addition of five spice. Love the stuff but for some reason I always forget about use it. When the marinade be prepare early in the day, dinner be a snap! I broiled, but a grill pan would work well, too. My kid enjoy this one, which be always 5 star at my house. Thanks, Sharon, for a wonderful dinner! We really enjoy this meal and will make again. This recipe be easy to make and taste delicious.   I choose sherry wine, dry basil and mince ginger.  I marinate them for one hour not the three and still taste very nice.  This recipe smelt so nice, the aroma be waft around the house.  Thank you Sharon123 Excellent. The aroma alone make for a five! The combination of herb and spice make for a wonderful and delicious meal. Made a post use whole breasts, freshly mince gingeroot, dry basil - only because I didn't have fresh. Used the optional crush red pepper flakes. Can't wait to serve it for those summer weekends, I know there will be recipe request on this one! Thank you for sharing. Excellent flavors!   I love the mixture and this be so quick and easy that I'll be keep it around. My husband and daughter actually like this dish more than I did.  I have just decide I be not a fan of Chinese Five Spice Powder.  However, that said, it be tasty and easy to make.  \\r\\nI make this ahead of time by slice the chicken breast, that I then place in a zip top bag with the marinade.  I place the reserve marinade in a second small zip top bag and froze.  I allow to thaw overnight in the fridge and cook a directed.  The only thing I would warn of be be careful a it be easy to over cook your chicken.  \\r\\nI serve with a quick low fat vegetable fry rice. I wasn't sure what to expect, have never use five spice powder before, but since we love ginger and garlic, I though I would give it a try!  It be delicious and we will definitely be make this again!  I use dry basil, fresh ginger (pressed through the garlic press), and sub vegetable broth for the sherry, since I have some to use up.  the chicken look a little dry when it be do broiling, but it be actually VERY moist and tasty.  And the leftover be really good in fry rice. :)  THanks for posting! yummy. I have some chicken breast from a 3 lb bag I have use for another recipe.  Mixed the marinade use chicken broth and dry basil.  Put it in a quart freezer bag with the freeze chicken and put it in the freezer.  Probably take 5-7 minute to put together (I be put another sauce together with some of the same ingredient and both take me le than 15 min).\\r\\n\\r\\nI take it out of the freezer one morning on my way to work.  When I get home, I put in the oven and fix some rice and veggies.  He love it!  It be definitely a 'keeper' and be be prepare this weekend for the freezer. I've make these several time and just now realize that I have never submit a review - how silly of me.  These be super simple and very very tasty.  Leftovers (if there be any) be great on salad the next day for lunch.  Thanks Sharon for a really easy recipe! I double up on the five spice powder and red pepper because we like it spicy.  Easy to put together and taste very good. A bite time consuming, but so flavorful!! My DH love it! Will make again! Yummmmy...this be SO delicious!\\nI use chicken stock and fresh ginger and basil in my version and marinate overnight,before cook the strip on an indoor electric chargrill hotplate.\\nThey turn out beautifully tender and pack full of flavour...and taste a little like a chicken version of Chinese Char Siu,which in my household (I'm half Chinese!) be no bad thing!\\nWe serve it on top of a fresh,crisp salad,and enjoy it no end.\\nThank you Sharon,for a fabulously tasty and simple recipe,that I will be use again!! This be so easy to prepare and delicious to eat! I use chicken tenderloin and cut them in half. Cooked them on the George Foreman grill for about 3-4 mins. They be nice and tender.

I also add the red pepper flake and bake the tenderloin in the oven. SO tender!! Made for Rookie Tag Game 2013.\",\n",
       " \" I make this twice yesterday, and it be very good. Its great a a 'dessert' after dinner.I make it with the white chocolate both times, but I think next time I'll leave it off. It doesn't add, or distract from the flavor, and since I be watch my weight, and be also a border-line diabetic, I can do without the extra sugar. Its very good. Very yummy! It's maybe a bite on the potent side for my taste, and a bite thin (I like my milkshake THICK!). But the flavor go very well together! I think I'd either use a smooth brandy (maybe a cognac) next time (my fault, a I just pick a small bottle more or le at random); I also add a bite more ice cream to make it thick to suit my taste. I didn't have any white chocolate, so I use some Scharffen Berger semisweet for the shavings. Thanks so much for posting, breezermom! Made for Holiday Tag game. Mmmmmm...this be so good. It make a great dessert! Made these for guest over the holiday and they love them. Thanks for sharing! This be a very decadent dessert drink indeed. I find it a little bite strong for my tastes, so I think I'd reduce the brandy just a little next time. I use vanilla bean ice cream instead of the french a a personal preference. I also sprinkle a little cocoa over the top of the white shavings, just because it be pretty. Made and Reviewed for Every Day Holiday Tag - Thanks! :) ohh so decadent and good.  I adore this, have to drink it through a straw due to a tooth problem and it make me feel happy lol. well once the 2nd one be down especially Very good! I use Kahlua instead of Creme de Cacao. I also make it ahead of time and pour into individual plastic cups. Placed in the freezer and serve after dinner. So yummy and great for an after-dinner drink/dessert. Yum! So simple and good. Thanks for share this recipe, breezer and congrats on your football win!\",\n",
       " \" I make these and when I taste them, they weren't a sweet a I expected.  I also double the top recipe because I like a lot of streusel top on my muffins, and I add some chop walnut to the top mix.  I enjoy them, but next time I will add maybe 2 tbsps of brown sugar to the muffin mix.  Thanks for the great starter recipe, though! Wish I live in an area where fresh cranberry be available year-round, but alas, I don't! I do with the one I've frozen, or buy dry one in bulk! Come the end of the year, however, I intend to really stock up & freese a lot of the buggers! Anyway, I make these with dry cranberries, & although they be great, make with fresh berry I'm sure they'd be on another level yet! Thanks for a great recipe! Wow, I can't believe how good these muffin be :)  Usually I don't do toppings, but this one I do it and I don't regret it.  In the muffins, I use only 1/2 cup sugar.  Thanks Redsie :)  Made for 123 hit wonders. These be really great, the top be just right! (I modify the recipe so there'd be le fat and for high altitude. I also add some white grape raisins, which I totally recommend.)\\nWill make again, though I think I'll double the top next time. Lovely muffins!  Nice moist crumb and just enough cranberry to make them flavorful but not too tart.  I double the topping, which be a bite more than I need but I use almost all of it.  I get 9 nice high regular-sized muffin from this recipe.  I think they would be great with some white chocolate chip - next time!  Thanks for sharing! Great muffins. I have never buy fresh cranberry before, and like the combination of the tartness with the sweetness of the muffin. I follow the recipe exactly execpt for sub applesauce for the oil in the batter and increase the cinnamon in the top a bit...maybe 1 tsp. Wonderful! These be moist and dense. I really like the topping. I be a little unsure of how it would turn out, I have never do a streusel top with oil before, but it very good. I make it down to the letter and the only thing I will do next time will be to add a little wheat germ, personal taste. Hi, Redsie! What a keeper recipe this is. So moist, yum, and just the right amount of sweetness and cranberries. I make these last night, and even though there be only 3 people in our family there be only 1 muffin left. Needless to say, we LOVE them. very delicious! i only have 1/2 a cup of dry cranberries, so i also add 1/2 cup of macadamien nuts. and since im vegan, i use orange juice instead of the milk, and instead of the egg, i use 2 tb of water, and 2 tsp of bake powder Great breakfast muffin. The only addition I make be to add 1 c. chop pecan to the batter, and use half whole wheat flour.  Loved these muffin Redsie! This be a great muffin for a snack or breakfast.  After read all of the review I do use 2/3 cup whole wheat flour and 2/3 cup all purpose flour.  I also sub orange juice for the milk a we always like orange and cranberry flavor together.  I also double the top ingredients.  I be so glad that I always freeze cranberry when they be in season, because that first batch didn't last very long. Great recipe!  I love the combination of sweet and tart.  The only change I make be the 1/2 whole wheat pastry flour and half all purpose flour, add the 2 T. of brown sugar that someone else have suggest to sweeten the batter slightly,  double the topping, and use applesauce instead of the 1/4 cup of oil.  They be still wonderfully moist and great the next day!  Thanks to all for the great hints. Scrumptious!! I also substitute the milk with OJ for a citrus taste... I also add about 1/3 cup of almond and a little almond extract- cranberry almond orange streusel muffins! I agree..Scrumptious! I use cranberry jelly instead of real cranberry and they be perfect. (I find real cranberry to sour anyway).  Great topping!\\r\\nUsed 1/2 whole wheat flour and butter in the top instead of oil. Awesome muffins! I add in chop pecan and these be so delicious!  I make a piggie of myself and have 3 with my coffee!  DH be right behind me grab for another one a he go out the door for work!  Great muffin that we will enjoy time and again! Yum!  I love the how tangy the cranberry be in this!   I would probably double the struesel recipe next time.  Thanks for a great recipe! YUM!  This recipe be EXACTLY what I be look for.  I be try to replicate something I fell in love with at a local coffee shop once.  I follow this recipe - except I double the streusel like other reviewer suggested, and use butter in the top instead of oil.  Delicious!  Update:  Made this again and substitute applesauce for 1/2 of the oil.  Didn't notice the difference!  Still moist and chewy.  (But... I chop the cranberry fine this time and didn't like that a much.  Halved or quarter berry deliver good flavor.) I really like these muffins, they remind me of a small coffee cake! Super yummy, the only thing I felt it lacked, be some salt.  Once I add 3/4 a teaspoon of salt, they be perfect! Thanks for posting! Very good muffins. I do add 1/2 teaspoon salt to the batter and that be just perfect. I barely have enough of the topping, so I would probably double it next time.\",\n",

I'd never have Blarney Castle cheese before but see a the local store actually have it and a far a I'm concerned, it's hard to go wrong with melt cheese LOL I decide to try this. I use a rhubarb chutney instead of Major Grey (I could have get the M.G. but I have this rhubarb stuff I'd be want to try, and it say on the jar it be good with cheese! :) ) I think this be an excellent sandwich! Thanks so much for post the recipe for it! Made this for a quick lunch - use smoke gouda cheese and mango chutney.  I don't know if it's the chutney I use - but it turn out quite sweet and I think I have put a bite too much chutney!!  I would make it again with le chutney or maybe try another brand!  Thanks twissis! :) Not your usual grill cheese, that's for sure! This be delicious. It be very different but in a good way! Loved the combination of ingredients. I use smoke Gouda for the cheese because that's one of my favorite type of cheese. Will make this again! Thanks for sharing! This be a great recipe Twissis.  I love this crisp, golden, sweet & tangy grill cheese sandwich.  The best flavor be always achieve with few ingredient and this tasty treat do not disappoint. I use a fresh sesame flatbread, provolone cheese and Major Grey Spicy Mango Chutney. This grill cheese be quick and easy to make.  I will be enjoy them for a long time to come. One of my favorite sandwiches.  I make it all the time.  I've use all kind of cheese: gouda, cheddar, provolone, muenster, and all kind of chutney (i usually make my own).  Obviously this be a very adaptable recipe and you can't go wrong.  Thanks for sharing, twissis! nice and cheesy--very good gouda--used the smoke variety with a tomato chutney. Of course, I have to add chipotle--we like it hot in Texas. Made for Football Pool, week 9, 2010. So cheesy good!  I use recipe #482860, the cheese i use be Kerrygold Dubliner. I didn`t think it be go to melt a nice a it did. Made for Lively Lemon Lovelies ZWT #8. Cheerio! This be grill cheese kick up a notch!  I use Major Grey mango chutney and gruyere cheese.  Great lunch - thank for share the recipe!  Made for ZWT8, Chefs go WILD! Totally different taste for me.  Kind of like peanut butter and jelly without the peanut butter.  I use Blarney Castle cheese and Major Greys chutney.  The flavor go together well.   Made for ZWT8 What a fun lunch I have today!  Just delicious.  Quick enough that I could make it and photo it on my one hour lunch break.  Just love the creamy cheese with the kick of the chutney.  Made for ZWT8.  Thanks for sharing!\",\n",
       " \" Mmmmm Yummmmy!! love the sauce, and the marinade!! the combination of ginger and walnut be ,wonderfull, lot of taste, and the garlic just set it off nicely.  This one will go in my hard copy. thank for share Di. This one will be a bite unusual a I post a request for Brocolli chicken and the gracious Lady Di (no pun intended) respond with this recipe and suggest I add brocolli. I do and the result be fabulous. No I do not have walnut so that change it up a bite (hence the name) but the flavor be excellent. I follow the recipe exactly only I remove the chicken long enough to saute some brocolli crown for 6 minute and add back the chicken and incorporate the sauce. The end result be a very velvety chicken with a wonderful sauce. We be really impress with how tender the chicken be and my dh say it be definitely restaurant quality. Thank you so much Di for the recipe and next time I will add the walnut (but the brocolli be nice too! Fantastic! I've be look for this recipe for years, a it's one of my favorites. Relatively easy to make, and just a I remember it -- in spite of some minor mis-planning on my part. Thank you! This taste just like what you would eat in a Chinese restaurant!  Very nice!  The only change I make be to marinate the chicken for 30 min instead of 10 min (at room temp) to make sure the chicken would be tender. Yum, this be awesome, the only thing I would do different be add some chili paste to make it spicy. Thanks! I have have this in my cookbook for quite some time, but finally get around to make it tonight while desperately search for something quick and easy that I could make that doesn't contain any onion or potato (out of both!).  It come together amazingly quickly (as be the tendancy of Chinese food, I guess), which be exactly what I be look for.  Very nice simple flavors.  I agree with Mom2girls, though, in that I would like a little spice or something- even though I normally can't stand spicy foods, I think that this would benefit from a small kick.  It's very kid-friendly a is, I think.  I didn't have walnut halves, so I just use walnut piece instead, although I think the halve would have be better, the piece be still good.  Served over brown rice with a variation of Mushrooms Oriental (#11365).  Good meal, thank for posting.   This be very tasty, but not anything like the restaurant walnut chicken my DH and I love.  Although not what I be expecting, this be overall a very nice dish. Thanks! this be pretty awesome! I think the sesame oil tie it all together. most walnut chicken i've have in restaurant have be extremly sweet this one have a great balance of sweet and savory. thank I like the idea of this a lot, but it just didn't work for me.  I have stainless steel pan and the coat stuck.  We weren't happy with the texture, but my dh say the sauce be great.  I would probably hunt down a nonstick before I make this again. My husband would like to give this more than 5 stars. I do find that I need to double the amount of ingredient in the marinade in order to cover the chicken - 4 tsp rice wine, 1 tsp ginger and 4 tsp cornstarch. And, I only use 2 oz of walnut a that be the size bag our store carries. I would like to try it with tofu for me.\",\n",
       " ' This be a nice change from the usual meatloaf. I make it use grind turkey and John Messmore\\'s Herb Seasoning / Salt Substitute Recipe #103336 plus a dash of salt for the \"herb-seasoned salt\". I really enjoy bite into the nutty middle. My only problem be that it turn out quite crumbly, and the meat mixture separate from the middle when I try to remove it from the loaf pan. There be also way too much to fit into a 9x5-inch loaf pan, so I be force to use leave out some of the filling. I would definitely make this again and reduce the amount of meat slightly, make sure to spread it all the way around the nutty center so it doesn\\'t separate.

First time make my own homemade potato chip and they be perfect.  I have problem with the vinegar air and end up make it twice.  I use &quot;Knox&quot; gelatin powder and in the direction it just say to be combine with 2 cup liquid.  The first time I use 1/4 cup water to soak the powder, then add boil 100 ml water and then the cool 150 ml of vinegar.  This never develop soft peak or even soft set in the refrigerator over night, so throw it out and start over.  This time I use 1/4 of cool water to soak the heap 1/2 tsp of gelatin powder, then add the remain water and the 150 ml of vinegar (which be boiling) to the soak mixture.  I whip for a long time with my KitchenAid mixer on high and, again, no soft peaks.  I decide to just refrigerate it over night and check it in the morning.  Yeah!!!  It work and be thickened!!  I then use my mandolin and mini fryer for the chip and re-whipped the vinegar with great results.  The only change I make be to use malt vinegar (personal preference - not so sweet) and use Himalayan sea salt.  I wasn&#039;t a fan of the cold vinegar/gelatin, would probably let it get to room temp. next time but really love the combination!!!  Thanks for share the recipe.  Made for PRMR Tag Game.',\n",
       " ' This be a very flavorful, yet easy to prepare dish.  I downsize to fee four & use chicken thigh instead of breasts, but otherwise follow the recipe a posted.  I like the subtle spiciness from the chili powder.  It be sweet, but not overly so.  I serve this withMizzNezz\\'s Fried Sweet Potatoes & Country Lady\\'s Pan Roasted Asparagus. Thanks, Jill. This be very popular at my house and so easy after work. I make several for the freezer after the first time we try this. I use black cherry jelly, a bite more chili powder and a couple of tablespoon of Worcestershire Sauce. This be good - follow recipe as-is. I place 2 BLSL Chicken Breasts per quart freezer bag and split the marinade 3 ways. This make 3 meal for us. I make this a a \"dump\" recipe by dump the chicken (I use thighs) and the ingredient into a ziploc bag and then freezing. To serve, I dump the content of the bag into my crockpot and then let it cook all day and it work perfectly. I have add this to my OAMC chicken collection, thanks! This be a delicious chicken recipe!  I use the sugarfree blackberry preserves.  I also use boneless chicken breast and do not brown them.  Thanks JillAZ for a wonderful easy recipe. A very good start to quick chicken. I use blackberry preserves. It be just way to sweet for our tastes. I end up use the chicken in a greek dish & it taste great! Next time I might use lemon preserves. I cook this in bulk (had a ton of ultra bargain chook to use) and so it probably didn\\'t get a fair go.  I leave the chili powder out co our family isn\\'t into spicy, and up the vinegar and worcestershire to give a bite more zing, but it still wasn\\'t remarkable once cooked, for us.  I probably wouldn\\'t cook this again. This be great.  I use orange marmalade because that be what I have on hand.  Yummy.  I split this into 3 bag with two breast each. This be amazing! I use about 1 1/2 lb of chicken, so I halve the recipe (I wish I hadn\\'t because the sauce be so good, I would have like extra!) This would be great on ribs, too. TFS! Excellent! really enjoy it - the combination of flavour be lovely and next time I think I\\'ll add a cleave of crush garlic too!  A previous reviewer miss the point of this recipe by omit the chilli - it\\'s not hot at all but the very subtle \"zing\" combine with the sweetness of the preserve and the sourness of the vinegar really works!  Make it but DO NOT omitt the chilli!  Chilli doesn\\'t necessarily mean spicy and how do your family know if you never experiment?  x Easy and yummy!  Dh tell me I need to make sure to have seedless though a he hat have seed in his teeth.  He do enjoy it though! I also do it a a dump recipe.  Thank you so much! :) Easy to fix and very delicious.  Fixed a the recipe direct and enjoy the result very muchy.  Will, however, try substitute chilli sauce for ketchup and chilli powder next time I fix just to see what difference that will make to the  taste.  I use raspberry preserves. This be a hit with my kid who be picky eaters.  I use Raspberry jam and they keep come back for more.  I will definitely make this again! One word to describe this be WOW!!! I just can not believe something so simple taste so good. My child and I just gobble this up. I change 2 thing in this recipe and that be I use cherry fruit only preserve and only one tsp of chili powder and it come out so wonderful and make the house smell so good when cooking. I serve it with rice and pour the sauce from the chicken on the rice. My son who dose not like rice even eat the rice with the sauce from the chicken. \\r\\nThank You so much for post this Jillaz,\\r\\nNaomi This be really good and easy to make. I use all boneless chicken cutlet and raspberry jam. I also wasn\\'t sure which type of vinegar to use so I use red wine vinegar. I follow the rest of the recipe a written. This have a wonderful taste to it. I cut down the cook time since I use boneless breast and I also cook them on the grill. I be really impress with the taste of these. Will be make more often. Update: Made this for freezer tag 2008. I make this a a dump recipe, add all the ingredient in a freezer bag and freezing. The day before making, I pull from freezer and thaw in the fridge. Cooked a directed. I notice someone else cook this in the crockpot, I think I might try that next time, use bone in chicken. Yummy, easy, a real kid-pleaser.  I use blackberry jam and balsalmic vinegar.  I will make this often! I prepare this recipe with blackberry preserves, and remove the skin from the chicken before baking. I will give this recipe another try, but will make it with a seedless raspberry jam and use a red wine vinegar (as suggest by another reviewer). Perhaps my family will like it good prepare with that flavor of jam and vinegar.  My husband and daughter want me to give this recipe 3 stars, but I like it, so I\\'m give it 4 stars. Thank you for the recipe Jill, I think it be good. Wow be this ever good!  I didn\\'t freeze mine, just make it fresh, and it be so easy to throw together.  Now my 3 little boy do gawk about it be rather pink in color (mine wasn\\'t real saucey like the pic, but it be good non-the-less) from the preserves/ketchup/I dunno, but they still eat it up :)  Definitely a keeper!  Thanks Jill! we enjoy this very much. I use apricot preserve and chicken thighs.  thank you very much. I use my homemade blackberry jam and wow! What flavor!  I, like Pamela, use it for a dump chicken so I didn\\'t get to taste the finish product but after taste the base I know it will be delicious...  Kinda like a hearty and sweet barbeque sauce. This be a really good OMAC recipe for chicken. I use blackberry preserve and b/s chicken breast and that turn the outside of the chicken purple. I didn\\'t brown the chicken first but fix it a a dump recipe and that may have be part of the issue with the purple chicken.\\nI will update this review the next time I make it. As you can see from the fact that I plan to make it again, the purple chicken didn\\'t bother u that much! The chicken be very tasty and tender. I make a similar recipe that the family love (recipe#81712) but I saw this in a chef\\'s Fav. of 2008 cookbook, so I want to try it.  Very easy to prepare.  I use about 2 1/2 lb s/b breast and save some of the sauce for dipping.  Also use bbq/ketchup mix and Fruits of the Forest spread.  Doesn\\'t need the salt and isn\\'t spicy at all.  It come out juice, but I brown it first and then cook for about 35-40 minutes.  Served with rice.  I prefer the other recipe, but the rest really like this.  So we\\'ll be make both regularly.  Easy recipe when you don\\'t want to cook. This be good, but I could have cut back a little on the chili powder, I think it be a bite overpower in this dish. I use raspberry preserves. We have this quite awhile ago and I forget to review it. It be very good, and I will be experiment with different jam and preserves. Thank you for sharing! Really, really, really good.  We bake ours in the oven although I think the next time we grill out I will prepare some a well. It be so yummy we be almost fight to lick the bake sheet, j/k but really we were. Very good...definitely would be good for a dump recipe - will be try it that way next time.  We use apricot jam and it give it a nice sweet taste with a kick. Sorry, but I be go to be \"odd man\" out!  This marinade do nothing for me....I find it way to sweet for my liking! I will pas on this one! Tasty recipe for homemade bbq sauce!  Based on the reviews, I reduce the blackberry preserve to approx. 1/3 cup or so.  I also add about 1 tsp onion powder to help balance out the sweetness.  It be a big hit at our house.  This recipe be a keeper! The chicken be nice and tender; however, I think I would prefer orange marmalade over black berry preserve and skip the ketchup.  Great recipe with lot of room for variations.  Thank you for share this.',\n",

       " \" Mmmm...  Mmmmm...  Mmmm!  This be really delicious!  I only have large chicken breast on hand, so I use three large (about 1.5 pounds).

       " \" My family make this same recipe, but instead of pretzel we use Chex cereal, either way, YUM! I print this recipe over a year ago and finally have the opportunity to make it.  Everyone who taste it comment on how much they like it (and of course want the recipe).  My husband cannot stay out of it!  Very simple to make!  You could even do this with Chex cereal, popcorn, or anything else similar.  I also think it taste good after it sit for a couple of days.  But either way, very good. Very good and very easy.  My kid ask to make it themselves, it that easy.  I use le oil than state and still taste great. I've make this a dozen time but without the lemon pepper, we use dill. I think the small round pretzel be the best because they hold the tasty stuff better. They do taste good on day 2 or 3 if you can save some for later. My sister also start make it with regular oil and some butter buds, I think about a Tablespoon or so. Like other reviewers, I let this mix sit a few days.  It still seem a tad oily, so just before serving, I put it in a brown grocery bag, shake it around, and let it absorb any excess oil.  Personally I think this mix be too salty, but it be heartily eat by guests.  I follow a reviewer's suggestion of add chex cereal to it a well (50/50 mix). I make a similar recipe, except I use the small pretzel twist , spicy ranch packet, colemans dry mustard, garlic powder, lemon pepper &amp; canola oil. I eye ball the measurement then I  mix in a very large bowl , pour onto a parchment line bake sheet to dry for about an hour then I store them in an &quot; UTZ&quot; pretzel container that I purchase from SAMS. My husband love these little guy and he let me know when the stash be get low lol....\",\n",

I will order a new one but I have all the stuff so I surf the net in hop of find the recipe. This be close. The original recipe call for 4 to 5 Thai chile (not 45) and coriander and cumin seeds. You have to dry cook the spice together then grind them up. Finally blanch the cilantro, basil and mint so the green color be retained. Aside from that it be the same.

Used cook chicken cub from my freezer.  This be easy and very tasty, I great change from the same old chili.  Next time I will use more squash, I really like it in this recipe.  Thanks, Olga! Delicious!  I couldn't find the dry chilies so just use chili powder.  Didn't have cinnamon stick so use powder too!  Used an extra tin of chili kidney bean - yum!\\nFantastic - definitely a keeper.  I join Recipezaar today just because this recipe be so good!  Thanks Olga! Awesome recipe. Hubby and kid both love it. The squash add a depth of sweetness to the dish, and it's so easy to make in the crock pot. I substitute grind venison for the beef, chili powder for the dry chili's and powder cinnamon instead of stick. This one be a keeper. This be the best chili. I've also make it with beef stew meat. The spice be what really give this chili depth and set it apart from the rest! My kid think this be the best chili I&#039;ve ever make (and I&#039;ve make some good ones). The butternut squash add a creamy quality -- in a good way-- and doesn&#039;t overpower with squashiness. The recipe definitely make more serve than listed. Leftovers freeze well.\",\n",

I use celery seed and onion salt instead of Onion powder and celery powder since it&#039;s hard to get them in AUS (well at least where I live). I make this roast pork yesterday for the church I attend a part of our Oktoberfest celebration. It be an easy recipe to follow and the result be outstanding. I actually cook enough pork for 80 - 100 people and receive many compliments. This recipe be a winner and I know I will be make it again very soon. Just try this recipe and be good, but I have to tweak the amount and still need some work. Instead of 1/4 teaspoon for the dry ingredients, increase to a whole teaspoon, and the salt increase to 2 or 3 teaspoins. I add 1 apple to the pot and mash the vegtables and return to the gravy. Slightly thicken with cornstarch. Would like to try juniper berry just to see the outcome.',\n",

I make this y\\'day (the 1st) and also use Devil\\'s Food cake a it all I have on hand:) It be sooo yummy! 2 peanut butter hater come over and love it! I like it much good today after it cool overnight. Sooo soft and yummy! The cake layer be a bite dry and crumbly but no so much after let it sit overnight. Thanks for an easy dessert!  One thing for sure.....it doesn\\'t get any better, or any easy than this....thanks for the great recipe!!!!! turn out great i do not have chocolate cake mix so i use yellow it be still wonderful This cake be easy, delicious, and rich - I warn my dh that it be rich, but he still cut a piece big than he could\\r\\neat. I share it with friend and they be already ask for more.  \\r\\nTheir kid love it!!!  I sure do plan on make it again -  can hardly wait to take it to our next church get together.   WOW!! Is there any recipe from Paula Deen that isn\\'t wonderful? This do not disapoint me at all. I could not find a 16 oz box of powder sugar so I use three and one half cups(did some check on the Cooking Q&A forum and should have use 4 cups),cooked it for 47 min and it be very gooey in the middle. But after it cool it firm up. Goes directly into my try and like cook book. I think this cake be FANTASTIC! I must admit it look like it be burn around the edge after 30 minute but be still really wobbly in the center so i leave it in for 40 minute and it be still wobbly so i bake it for the entire 50 minutes. Its not burn at all it just look that way but it be soft and delicous. As it cool the cake pull away from the side of the pan and be YUMMY!! Its even good the next day.  A keeper for my family I can\\'t believe I take a photo but never rat this! It be so good! I take it to a potluck at church and numerous people ask for the recipe! It be go before all the other desserts! And there be lot of desserts! Thanks so much for post this Barb! :) This cake be absolutely sinful.  It need to come with warnings:  must only be make when plan be to take it out of the house!  It be fantastic!  thank for sharing! Everyone in the house love this cake and it be very easy to prepare. Thanks! This be definitely yummy. I do decide to leave out the butter in the filling. I have a similar recipe with yellow cake mix, minus the PB that doesn\\'t call for any butter in the filling, so I think I would try this one without any. I bake it a with my other recipe also, which be at 350 for 35 minute and then turn the oven off and let it sit inside for 15 more minutes. It turn out great. I can\\'t wait to share it with my friend who give me the other recipe. Thanks, Barb. I will be make this again. although my cake didn\\'t look anything like the beautiful picture posted, that didn\\'t stop everyone from inhale it. I make this for a youth function at Church and every other dessert be basically ignored. I follow the suggestion of bake for 35 minute and let sit in the oven for 15 minutes. It be really hard to tell if it be done, but it definitely live up to the \"gooey\" title. One of the men ask for this cake for his birthday-that be impressive! I make this for my DH birthday and he love it, peanut butter be his favorite food group although he isnt to big on chocolate.  My mother and step father have some too and my step dad absolutely enjoy every bit, we give him the rest of the cake because although he LOVES sweet he be go throw chemo right now and cant eat a lot of stuff.  I be make it for one of our christmas dessert for both of them.\\r\\nI do change one thing about this cake though, I didnt have any cake mix, but I have Ghirardelli brownie mix and use that instead, i be afraid the brownie might get to hard, but they didnt and I probably wont use the cake mix because I like the result of the brownie mix so much.\\r\\nTHANK YOU BARB for a recipe my whole family love and be so simple to make :) Oh my.  This be sinfully rich, but soooo delicious.  I love it a do my whole family.  I will be make this again and again and again....lol.  I really like the fill so good.  Thank you for posting.....STephanie Oh this be so good! Rich beyond belief! Thanks Barb I make this cake to take along for our first night of vacation. It be wonderful and everyone rave about how yummy it was. It be very easy to make and be a great choice to take along. I will make this one over and over. Thanks for the great recipe... I have to admit, I be somewhat skeptical about the \"gooey\" part, but it turn out to be my favorite.  My husband love peanut butter anything, so I fix it for his birthday.  He love it!  Thanks! The cake turn out rich and delicious. I use P. B. Loco\\'s peanut butter with caramel and that turn out wonderfully. Kat be go to love this one! :D Thanks Barb. I think this be good than the original Gooey Butter Cake I have be make for years.  Definately not a diet food, but worth the calories.  My co-worker love it. This be so good. Especially the next day after it be cooled. Thanks! Took it to a potluck and all the adult love it. The most popular dessert! I love the recipe!!! I make the chocolate cake part with a triple chocolate brownie walnut mix and use extra chunky peanut butter, OMG it be awesome!!! I agree the next day when it be cooled, it be so much better! AWESOME.  Best yet!!! Anything by Paula Deen be gonna be GREAT!!! Oh my goodness. This be just a delicious a everyone says. I have to alter it slightly, a I be low on powder sugar than I thought. I use a bite of brown sugar and white sugar to substitute, and it be incredible! Spot on! Super yummy cake that be easy to make.  The bottom layer taste a lot like a brownie.  I will definitely make it again. Very good but very, very rich. This recipe be a really high fat & high calorie recipe, so I cut it down a little by using-- light Country Crock, reduce fat peanut butter, reduce fat/light cream cheese. And it taste amazing!  Adding the fat-free whip cream or light ice cream add some calorie back in but it need to cut the richness. Four star due to the high fat/cals. Also, very easy to make.',\n",
       " \" this be an awesome recipe Ooops! I didn't notice until after I add the stock, that this call for far more stock than I would normally use to cook this amount of rice. And, indeed, I get a gluey, over-cooked, dish. I cut this in half, and also experiment with cook it in the rice cooker. That part work very well. I put in the butter and oil (less than call for) and the onion, and cook it for about 5 minute before add the the rice and saffron. I stir that up for a minute or so, then put in the stock, put on the lid, and let the rice cooker do its' thing. I be generous with the saffron and chives. This could be an easy and subtle, pleasant rice dish, but you should use about half the amount of stock call for in the recipe.  Outstanding!  I reduce the stock to 4 cup and it be perfect.  Served for company a a easy but elegant and delicious side. Great rice that would go wonderful with grill chicken or fish if you like.\\r\\n*NOTE* I think the 5 cup liquid in the recipe be a typo. I put this together in my\\r\\nrice cooker add 3 cup of stock and that be perfect. \\r\\nI didn't have the full amount of chives. I use what I have and just put them in my RC instead of mix them in @ the end. This be my new FAV food!! I love it! i be amaze at how good it was. I have never use saffron before> Now i need to use it more. I love it!! Thank you sooo much.\\nP.S i cut the stock in half and it be perfect!\",\n",
       " ' While I honestly don\\'t remember Wild Sauce I have to say this be very good and taste like something we could get at Taco Bell.  I make a 1/2 recipe with no problem - will likely make again. Hi Steve!! I didn\\'t know this be your recipe till I be ready to rate it! Great sauce!! I can\\'t tell ya how many time I\\'ve make it.. I\\'m guess 6 time in a week. Our neighbor have me make it twice. I finally print the recipe off for them. I make it, a it be posted. No changes. Except for today... I be low on onion flakes.. That didn\\'t seem to make a huge change. In place, I add a bite of onion soup mix (the dry stuff.) lol My DH say this be THE best hot sauce I ever made! *YAY* Huge high 5 to you! Its good stuff.. Sorry my pic isn\\'t the best. I\\'m lucky I get one. This sauce go FAST in my house. DD put it on everything. Neighbors LOVE it. This deserve more than 5 stars!! Thanks for sharing. :) Great job duplicate this recipe! It be very close to how i remember it. Zesty! I think this recipe be very close, however, I think it need more vinegar. I add 1/2 cup and it taste great. I remember this sauce be tangy and the original recipe just didn\\'t do it. I also add just a few cilantro leaves, not a many a someone else suggested, but a few (maybe 8 actual leaves). I make this for the first time today!<br/>It\\'s really good.<br/>I like mine extra hot, so I do these modifications:<br/><br/>1.  Used about 1/8 cup of Tabasco (yes, an eighth of a cup).<br/>2.  Used extra-hot chili powder.<br/>3.  Instead of plain vinegar, I use the liquid from the jalapeno jar.<br/>4.  Used extra-strength cayenne (250,000 scoville unit of heat)<br/>5.  Used mince garlic instead of mince onion (I think it have more flavor)<br/>6.  Used two teaspoon of sugar instead of just one.<br/><br/>This be really good!<br/>I love it!<br/>Deliciously hot, and so flavorful I could eat it with a spoon if I really want to. :) Very good on just about anything. Prepared first a on recipe, then add more jalapeno, sugar, salt, onion and garlic powder. Turned out even better. I\\'m go to try it and I\\'ll let you know what I think.  I love this sauce so much that I use to order 2 taco and 2 bean burrito with extra-extra wild sauce.  If they didn\\'t put enough on it, I\\'d ask for more.  Surprised you didn\\'t add cilantro and a tsp of soybean oil.  I\\'ve post on separate wild sauce blogs, and mention to them that someone at Taco Bell give me a hand write recipe of the wild sauce - but not the exact one, because they weren\\'t permitted.  It have cilantro, green chilies and soybean oil for sure.  Until then, let see how it goes. I don\\'t remember Taco Bell\\'s wild sauce, but  I think I would give this recipe a try for our tostadas. It be just what I be wanting. Tangy, spicy and mouth watering. Great taco sauce! Even better, it be a breeze to make. Thanks for sharing, this will be my \"go to\" red taco sauce recipe. FREAKING AMAZING !!!! Refilled one my TB taco sauce bottles.. then portioned/froze in take-out cups... I&quot;ll pop em out, and vacuum seal them .. 2 of the large cup refill the taco sauce bottle.... My NEW FAVORITE Taco Bell Sauce..',\n",

I will add this to my list of weeknight regulars! I think this be very good and very easy.  I will definitely do this one again.  I use low fat cream of chicken soup and I think next time I will use le cheese. This be similar to one of our family favorite only, better. I add a can of cream of broccoli soup in addition to the two cream of chicken to make a little \"gravy\". The next time, though, I will reduce the cheese by half. Three cup be a bite much for our tastes. Still, this recipe have replace the old one in my recipe file! I have try this recipe for a Lunch for Friends and every on want the recipe. Very tasty and easy.  Kid pleaser. This be a very good recipe that be easy to make.  I add a small saute onion and matchstick carrot to the recipe along with a can of slice mushroom and a brick of cream cheese.  In our family anything can be make good with cream cheese, onion and mushrooms!!!  The carrot be add in because I have them in the fridge and need to use them.  My husband think it taste a lot like a cheesy pot pie and my 4 year old daughter think that it be very \"Yummy in my Tummy\".  It will definately go down on my \\'to-do-again\\' list.

Very, VERY good. Everyone want seconds! This one\\'s a keeper.Thanks! This be fantastic!!  The whole family enjoy it.  I serve it with garlic chicken rice and green beans.

It be very easy to make and so cheesy and delicious!  A favorite in my book! My partner tell me three time \\'this be a keeper!\\'. We both really love it and eat more than we should have.\\n\\nI do use exactly one pound of fresh boneless skinless chicken breast. I grill it and cut it up small. I have to modify a lot from there though. I only need 1 can of cream of chicken soup and 1 cup of shred cheese. Then about another cup on top of the roll at the end. That be plenty of cheese.\\nA great recipe and one we\\'ll be make again.',\n",
       " \" the recipe be excellent. I do not need to make any adaptions.\\r\\nWill make it many more time mmmmmmmmmm mmmmmmmmmmmm good. This be a great recipe for the bread machine. I convert it to a 2 lb. loaf. I follow the recipe exactly a converted. It be perfect. Made a very large 2 lb. loaf. I'm not big on raisin either, may try to make without them next time a hubby doesn't like them at all. Thanks for sharing!! This be a delightful bread! The raisin and honey add just the right amount of sweetness to this loaf.  I use Quaker Quick-1 Minute Oats, a this be all I have on hand, which give this bread a denser, chewy texture.  Very, very nice!  I will enjoy this a toast with cinnamon and sugar in the morning!  Thank you so much, Capncrunch! I be expect a sweet bread.  I use it for toast and it taste good like that. I don't think I like it enough to make it again.   This be delicious, nice texture and the honey give it an awesome flavour..really like the combination of the oat and the raisins..I will make this again. Excellent bread that rise just short of the lid of the breadmaker! Great consistency and texture. I'm not rat this because although the flavor be good, something go wrong.  Actually, a couple of thing go wrong.  I add the oat and raisin a direct in the recipe, but they never get mix in well with the dough.  I have pocket of dry oat in the finish loaf.  Next time, I will add the oat with the flour.  The other thing be that mine do not rise much at all.  I know my yeast be good, so I wonder if that be relate to the oat not mix in--maybe the dough be too sticky to rise well?  I don't know.  In spite of all that, the flavor really be good, and I'll definitely try this again and see if I can make it work next time. This bread be perfect.  I add a handful of walnut and 2 tsp. of cinnamon.  I will be use this tomorrow to make french toast for a special brunch for my 'PEST' friend Leslie on her graduation morning.  The house smell heavenly a  this be baking.  I do take it out of the breadmaker and put it in a regular loaf pan to rise and bake. Easy to do, rise beatifully, make again raisin bread, and great that it have oatmeal in it too. Wow be this good ! DD#2 and I really like the texture of this bread. It be terrific warm w/ butter. I'll be make this one again. I might add some cinnamon and/or some nut to it next time. Thanks for post ! We love this! I use quick cook oat and add pecans, cinnamon and nutmeg and a tiny bite of brown sugar. My husband doesn't even like oatmeal but he have LOVED this. Eat it with a little butter on it warm up. YUM!!  Thank you for post this! It's a keeper. this be a great recipe i try it out in my bread machine i get this chistmas and i love the bread but i need to add more honey to taste kinda sweet and add more flavor so the bread taste like a reg bread off the shelf without the extra honey and i also add pecan it be a great addition This be my new standard raisin bread recipe!! It rise nicely, and the taste & texture be wonderful! I add a teaspoon of cinnamon, and use quick oats. I add the oat in step 1 instead of add them late with the raisins. I set the bread machine for the 'Dough' cycle, then knead the dough and place it in a grease loaf pan to rise. (By the way, it be easy to handle, and I didn't even bother flour the counter!) After it be risen, I bake it in a 385 F oven for about 24 minutes. When cooled, I cut into slices. It be easy to slice without 'caving in'. The bread be soft and moist, with a crisp crust. Delicious! This would also make an awesome regular white loaf without the addition of raisins! Thanks for post this recipe, Capncrunch! This be a wonderful bread.  It be so easy and come out look gorgeous.  I love homemade bread a toast and this bread make yummy toast!  Thanks for the recipe! I use Demerara sugar in place of the honey, 50% whole wheat flour and 1 tsp. of cinnamon and it come out great.  I do have to add 2 Tbsp. of water when I add the raisin and oatmeal to help blend into the dough.  Used sweet bread set and medium crust. Our whole family love this bread. I add the oatmeal with the liquid because we it le crunchy. Also add 1 tsp cinnamon. Smells like cinnamon roll when it be baking! We just finish sample this bread and both of u give it 10 stars!  I soak the raisin in a bite of brandy and add 1 tsp. of cinnamon.  I have to add a bite more flour but fingure that be because the raisin hadn&#039;t totally drained.  I use the ABM on dough cycle and then split the dough into two loaf pans.  Baked the loaf at 350 for 35 minutes.  My kitchen still smell like heaven!  Thanks. Loved this bread! I make a few adaptation from the reviews. I add 1 tsp of cinnamon and substitute unsulfured molasses for the honey. I put the water and old fashion oat in the bread machine first, along with the raisin a my machine doesn&#039;t have a delay intake for them. Thank you, Capncrunch for a great recipe. I&#039;m go to try your Creamed Cinnamon Raisin Nut Bread (#66940) today.\",\n",
       " ' Not only be this dish easy and absolutey delicious, it be so beautiful on the plate! I double the complete recipe but do not double the OJ, I add in 2 tbsps fresh chop garlic when sauteeing the brocolli and peppers, and also use fresh ginger, soooooo good! I serve it with cook rice, I will definately make this again, thanx Nims!...Kitten:) This be a great basic stirfry sauce!  For vegetables, I use carrots, celery, green onion and shred cabbage (what I have in the refrigerator).  Next time, I\\'ll try Kittencal\\'s suggestion re: garlic and fresh ginger.  Thanks! This be a very nice stir fry dish.  I double the sauce a recommended, but maybe next time will double all ingredient except the OJ.  I like the \"citrusy\" flavor, but it be a little overpowering.  I don\\'t know if it be because I double the sauce or not.  For vegetable I use broccoli, red and yellow peppers, onions, cabbage and carrots.  Because of personal preference I cook all the veggie (except the broccoli) long than recommended.  Carrots always need to be cook long for me.  This be super easy to make and would be on my list for weeknight suppers.  Thank you! This be a wonderful dish and would be equally good with pork. I use the broccoli a specify and throw in some julienne baby carrots. I use 1 cup of oj with 1/2 a fresh orange, place remain ingredient for the sauce in the Vita-Mix and blend well. Next time I will do the same except reduce the amount of juice to 1/2 cup and keep the fresh orange at 1/2. The vegetables, include carrots, be crisp tender in the time it take the shrimp to cook and sauce to thicken. Served this over a brown rice blend for a delicious and fill meal. Well....... it look great in the picture, which be why I try it, but unfortunately I find it pretty bland (the sauce that is). I really want to like it, but there wasn\\'t much to it for me. family love it.next time i\\'m go to try it with one change 1 teas. corn starch. otherwise excellent Nimz, a very different recipe with the orange juice in the sauce. We like it, but it could easily be overpowering, so next time I will be double the vegetable and keep the sauce the same. I add onion to my stir fry because we like them, and use fresh grate ginger because I couldnâ€™t find my grind ginger anywhere. DH and I both felt that if I hadnâ€™t use fresh ginger, then the orange *might*  well have be overwhelming. Its an excellent recipe though and with  a few tweeks to suit us, the sauce will be a regular addition to our wok dishes. Please see my rat system, a wonderful 4 stars. Thanks! make it tonight!! it be great!! will make again. thank you This be a great, great shrimp dish in my book. We love the sauce, and have everything right on hand for it. I use temple orange that we be give in place of the orange juice (2) and be knock out by the taste. Citrus add to soy, ginger, and brown sugar make a delightful sauce and all the fresh vegetable just drink this right up. I marinate the shrimp in half the sauce first, and this give them a big start on robust, but smooth flavor. Topped the shrimp, vegetables, and sauce on top of basmati rice, and throw a couple of cherry tomato and slice green onion on top of that. Terrific, and will use again and again. Excellent!  I use fresh grate ginger, and add some red pepper flake into the sauce (which I doubled).  It have a great zing to it and will be make again for sure! Nimz , This be extremely good! I add a handful of water chestnut and snow pea pods.plus about one tblspn of freshly mince garlic. I also cook the broccoli and pepper a bite longer.  Next time  (and there will be a next time) I will add some fresh ginger instead of dried.  The orange juice give it the right amount of tang without be too  orangey.\\nMy husband be very pleased!    Thanks so much! Yummy!!! I make this last nite with no change to the recipe ....Great recipe !!!   Thank\\'s Nimz for a real winner!!!! Excellent recipe!  I double the recipe - but leave the OJ at the original amount - use snow peas, diagonally slice carrots, garlic, broccoli, slice green onions,pepper flakes, didn\\'t have a green pepper so I use red and orange which I have on hand - all idea from read the other reviews.  I will definitely make again only I think I will only use 1/4 of orange juice or omit it all together. The entire family love it, every plate be cleaned!  Thanks for sharing! This be bland.  I follow others advice and reduce the orange juice, but other than that I follow the recipe a written.  The sauce just didn\\'t have enough flavor for me. this be real good. I will be make it again. Made exactly a state and it taste great; I think there be a bite too much sauce though a it wasn\\'t like other stir fry dish I\\'ve had, so I would follow other reviewer\\'s advice and reduce the OJ. Other than that it be easy to make and tasty!',\n",
       " \" Only change I make be add 2 tsp. Spicy Hot Pizza season by McCormick.  Bread rise well, smell so good and taste yummy.  A little bite of heat (I may double jalapeno next time) and a delicious hint of cheese flavor.  I think this bread would make the best grill cheese sandwiches!\\r\\n\\r\\nI make dough with mixer and dough hooks.  Baked bread be loaf pan in oven. Loaf turn out golden brown after cook it about 35-minutes at 350 degrees.\\r\\n\\r\\nI will make this again, and want to try add diced, cook pepperoni.  Chia, thank for share another great recipe. I try your bread in my bread machine,I read BeachGirl review so I add some pepperoni,it be fabulous,with rigatoni.Thanks Chia,also BeachGirl. This make a nice loaf of jalapeno cheddar bread.  I like the texture and it slice nicely for sandwiches. I use fresh jalapeno and seed them.  Next time I will add a few more to up the heat a bit. Thanks chia for share a keeper!  I would totally give this 5 starts. I think it turn out so yummy, and moist!  I would add more jalapeno flavor next time, and definitely more seed than I used, but it turn out beautiful. I always stop my bread 5-10 min before it's done, and it be perfect :) Thanks for this yummy recipe! I write it down and add it to my stash!\",\n",

Good one be add to my salad collection a this one have been. Did have to use bow tie instead of the orecchiette but they work well - will be look for the orechiette next city shop.Other then use the bow tie I make a post with wonderful results.  Krafts Classic Herb be excellent but I be sure a homemade herb dress would work equally well. Thank you - we enjoyed.',\n",
       " \" Overall very good, my 4 chicken breast weigh between 7 1/4 and 8 ounce so allow 45 minute cook time for them and use 4 medium potato cut into quarter (should have cut small a even after an hour cook they be still a little raw but the chicken be become too dry, so we served). I do use parsley instead of cilantro/coriander a we don't like it and overall the meal be enjoyable. I be surprise at the DM eat the potatoe wedge a normally she will not eat potato with skin on. Thank you TereseS, one we will try again, make for Please Review My Recipe. This be an easy and flavorful chicken dish!  I halve the recipe and use a small red potato.  Very tasty and healthy - thank for post this recipe! Next time I will add more ginger... I could hardly taste it. It be a very moist chicken and easy. I use 3 small red potatoes. Made for 1-2-3 Hits Tag Game 2010. this be easy and good. I also use small potato and we serve this with mix vegetables. A very easy and good dinner. Thanks for sharing! I know that I&#039;m an easy grader BUT to me this be worth all 5 start a my DH eat it with gusto and clean his plate!!  I use 3 thin slice of ginger and pull it out after cook so he wouldn&#039;t see it and we both love it. I might add that we&#039;re currently in a real heat wave and the last thing I want to do id use the oven. I cook this, covered, on the top shelf of the outdoor grill with the lid down. Took the foil off for about the last 10 mins. Oh yeah, and I use a large bake potato diced.\",\n",
       " \" Hummmmm, this be the first time that I even try use the bread maker for cranberry sauce or the jam cycle at all for that matter. I don't know if every bread maker would give the same result or if my Zo just really let me down on this. The sauce it's self end up lovely and tart and I have no problem recommend that part at all. The problem be the bread maker, it didn't get hot enough to make all (or even most) of the berry pop and it be like the berry be just sit on red water. Not want to sit through another 1:20 cycle I just put it all in a lidded pot and simmer the lot for 15 mins. At the end of that time when I take the lid off all of the berry have pop and there be thicken happening, yay. If I try this in the Zo again I'll chop the berry first. Oh! and I do add some extra sugar a the juice I use be organic and unsweetened. The color of this sauce be a deep and gorgeous deep red that could inspire your entire holiday theme. :D\",\n",
       " \" These be just excellent.  However, the amount be way off for me.  I make Miller's Puff Pastry recipe #16834 and measure my 6 four inch squares, and fill each square with 2 tablespoon of the spinach mixture and I still have over half the spinach mixture left.  I have enough pastry to make 1-2 more and still have a huge amount of spinach mixture leave over.  I'm go to wrap it in a tortilla and bake it sometime in the next couple of days.  Luby you might want to recheck the original recipe.  Or do tell, I certainly could have mess it up, but I'm pretty darn sure I follow the recipe to a T.  Anyway, this be certainly worth trying, bear in mind that you may have extra filling.  One other think, the egg yolk brush make these look like you put a thin coat of mustard on it before baking.  I'll leave that part out next time.\",\n",

       " \" Heather, this be a great sound recipe when I first saw it for our cookout-cookathon.  I make the marinade, but I use filet instead of the chuck steak.  It be wonderful.  I be addict to lime and cilantro anyway, and this be a great marinade.  I will use it again.  Thanks for post this recipe. ;-) Heather, this be really good. I do omit the cumin (just have too much this week) and use about 2 tbsp Worchestershire instead (for the spice and color). I know that really change the recipe--sorry. Next time I will do it by the book. I be amaze how the lime juice go to work tenderize the meat. I use a top round and you could cut it with a fork. Also I be a little concern when I taste the marinade and it seem really hot but the finish product be not hot at all. Just a nice crispy edge on a juicy piece of meat. And so flavorful. 5 star to you! Thanks.  Very good!  I use the marinade, a written, on a 1 1/2 lb. flank steak, which I lightly score on both sides.  It pick up the flavor very well and my family enjoy it very much.  I serve this with a nacho casserole and grill banana peppers.  Wonderful dinner!  thank Heather :) Excellent!  I be worry that an 45min would not be enough time to marinate, but it turn out fantastic.  The lime really add a wonderful dimension that I be not expecting! I follow another person's post advice about scour the steak and I think it really help soak up the yummy flavor! This be a good quick marinade.  I leave out the jalapeno because I didn't have one and add red pepper flakes.  They work well.  I would like to try this again with the jalapeno and maybe some more heat.  Thanks for sharing! I really enjoy the flavor of this marinade. I, too, skip the jalapeno, but the cilantro and lime combo be delightful. This turn out great, it my family's favorite. I make this for my family tonight, and all three of my girl couldn&#039;t get enough.  Perfect balance of taste nothing overpower or overwhelmed.  I use this with t-bone steaks, and it be perfect!\",\n",
       " ' After four year of search for a wonderful gluten free bread recipe, I have find it! This one be by far the best. It freeze nicely too. Hi! I read all the review here and well I give it a try, but the result wasn&acute;t so good at others. My bread end up be too gooey, I do add the xantham gum and egg replacer. What do I do wrong? I follow all the step to the T. Help please. This bread be wonderful!  Easy to make.  I didn\\'t have fast rise yeast so I use regular, and let it disolve.  I would however recommend use the Italian loaf pans.  Mine expand outward but not in hight.  Excellent bread!  Will make again and again. Thanks! Wonderful!  Just wonderful!!  I wouldn\\'t have know I be eat gluten free bread if I hadn\\'t make it myself.  The texture be perfect and the flavor great.  The first time I make this I make 2 loaf in french bread pans.  It make pretty small loaves, so the next time I make just one loaf in a regular loaf pan.  It make a nice size loaf which slice perfectly for sandwiches.  My celiac stepdaughter be just thrill with this bread! Fantastic! I initially give this four star and say that the taste be perfect and the texture be close. I decide to come back and change it to five because the texture be perfect too. I taste the bread (and then review it) straight out of the oven and it be really good, but not great. After let the bread cool completely and then brush the slice with garlic butter and pop it back into the oven, this be 100% the same a regular wheat french bread. I\\'ll definitely be make this again. Thanks! Another great gluten free recipe! The texture be superb and it bake up nice and crusty on the outside and soft on the inside just a you say! I use a french bread pan and get 2 nice loaves. Thanks for share such a wonderful treat! :) This bread be outstanding! I have make it 3 or 4 time and each time my husband (who be gluten-intolerant) comment about how wonderful it taste and how nice it be to be able to have bread just like he use to eat.  Thanks, GlutenFreeGirl, for this excellent recipe.  (I\\'m make some right now!) This be really good! I wasn\\'t sure I\\'d like it with all the white rice flour, but even though the rice flour I use be grainy, the graininess actually add a good texture to it. The flavor be good and even my gluten-eating husband like it. Thanks for the recipe! so far the only GF bread we\\'ve try that actually taste like FRESH bread. Thank-you, thank-you, thank-you! Amazing!  The only gf bread that taste like the real stuff!  \\nI find I have to add extra flour, but thats no big deal.\\nI make it in my bread maker today and it be great! Gluten free since last Thursday.  My husband love it and so do I!\\r\\nThank you! This really IS a good a it sounds!  Thanks! still taste good use brown rice flour! best the first day, while still warm. Great right out of the oven!  My husband didn\\'t realize it be GF! I slice up what be leave after dinner, coat with EVOO and some season and have awesome coutons later. This be wonderful!  I love the texture and the taste, and the fact that it be so quick and easy.  Thank you so much for this recipe, GlutenFreeGirl! :) Yummy!  Very nice texture.  We have about 1/2 loaf leave over and make crouton the next day they be soooo goood!!!!   toast them in a pan w/garlic, butter and thyme and then shred parm. cheese on top. I think that they be even good that regular gluten croutons.   I will be put this into my recipe box.\\nThank you so much. I absolutely LOVE this recipe!! I haven\\'t have french bread in a couple year since go gluten free, and this be definently a wonderful treat. I will be use this recipe a lot! UPDATE: I just have to say that everyone I have ever make this for (mostly people who don\\'t have gluten intolerance) just LOVE this bread!! It\\'s always request when my friend and I get together for a pot luck dinner :) Now that\\'s say something! I guess I be go to have to re-make this bread.  This be the first gluten free bread that I have ever make and the stuff be terrible.  Sorry, did\\'t do it for me at all I don\\'t know why my star rat say \\'no stars\\' because I give this recipe 5 big ones!! \\nUndoubtedly the BEST gluten free bread I\\'ve ever eaten!  And so easy to make.  First time I make it I follow the recipe to the letter and the bread be great, but one of my complaint about GF cook be the high starch content and the lack of fiber.  So the 2nd time I make it I use part brown rice flour, Bob\\'s Red Mill all purpose flour and the tapioca and make bread sticks.  Again it be wonderful!  Tonight I use 1 c. brown rice flour, 1/2 c. sorghum flour, 1//2 c. amaranth flour and 1 c. tapioca and make rolls.  Good again!  The dough be really sticky and hard to work with so I put it in a pastry bag and pipe it out into the shape I want, either bread stick or rolls.  Next I want to try it in a regular bread pan.  Oh, I also use it for a pizza crust.  Next time I will bake it for about 10 minute and then put on the topping and bake for another 10 minutes.  All sort of possibility with this recipe!!  Thank you!  Thank you! Great recipe.  I have prepare and try many and this by far be the best.  \\n\\nMy whole family live on a gluten free diet so, you can say this be a \"Gluten Free Family Approved Recipe.\"\\n\\nThanks.\\nHappy Dad I love this bread! I use 1 cup of white rice flour and 1 cup of brown rice flour and it still turn out great and taste wonderful. I love that it be crispy in the out side and soft inside just like french bread be suppose to be. After become allergic to gluten a few year ago I never think I would taste good bread again. But thank to this recipe I be wrong! :) Great bread, I love it! All though I do see this exact recipe in a cookbook last week - I didn\\'t know if it be important or not to cite sources. WOW - most GF bread be dense and have a dry crumbly texture (kind of like corn bread). You can\\'t even tell the difference between this and regular French bread. Never think I\\'d ever in my life be bake bread but this be a great recipe and easy to make. Bravo .... I join all the others comment in the kudos and thank you\\'s. This recipe be a life saver. I might add a little more sugar next time to make it taste more like french bread. But it really be good. I give it to my non-celiac friend and they love it! Good taste and texture.  I like use pan for uniform shape and size This turn out well.  I bake it for 40 min. The bread be slightly  gummy in the center, which seem to happen to all of my gluten free breads.  Good though, soft on the inside and crunchy, chewy on the outside. Love this!  My (non GF) family love it too.  To shape quickly and easily I spray the inside of a lg ziploc with canola oil, put the dough in, snip a pretty lg whole and pip out perfect loaves.  Thanks for a great recipe! This be such a great recipe! It be simple and turn out great!!  It go really well with my lasagna. So good! We want to turn some slice into French toast, but alas, we eat it all before we could!  We sub 2 teaspoon of grind flax seed for the egg substitute. I highly recommend this recipe! I just make this. My first attempt at a Wheat Free Bread! \\r\\nI didn\\'t use the egg sub, and use 2 whole egg for the 3 egg whites. I end up with a nice \"eggy\" textured bread..Okay so it\\'s not French Bread..but it\\'s tasty, plain, with a bite of jam...and I think leftover may become bread pudding!\\r\\n~made this again into personal sub size rolls~following the recipe to a T..It be wonderful!! I have try several Gluten-free bread recipe and this be the first one that the whole family really loved! Thank you so much for this recipe!  I think it have be nearly 2 year since I have taste (wheat) french bread and this great.  I ask my daughter what she would rate this on a scale of 1 to 5, she say 300, LOL.  Guess it be a thumb up here.\\r\\n\\r\\nOne tip, it start to look like it be brown too fast so at about 25 minute I cover it with a sheet of tinfoil.\\r\\n\\r\\nI be go to review this after a day or so and see how it hold up...but we only make one loaf...and eat it all.\\r\\n\\r\\nAnd like another viewer suggested, this will make great hamburger bun and what ever else I can think of.  :o) Oh, lordy, after year and year of have to go without French bread - the best bread ever create - it be heaven to find this recipe!  Thank you!  This be one I will be make again and again...and again. The look of this bread be beautiful and so be the texture...but there be WAY to much yeast. But hey if you like the taste of really yeasty bread go for it. I follow the recipe exactly. It turn out perfectly! Looks beautiful and taste just right-crusty exterior and soft interior. Definitely check before 40 minute though, mine be almost too brown on the bottom. This bread be just what the author said... crusty outside and soft inside.  I follow the recipe except for use half of the yeast.  The bread hold together well for sandwich and make great garlic bread.  I give this bread 4 star because it be very starchy. First of all, the flavor be incredible for a GF bread.  It\\'s a close to the wheat version a I have ever tasted.  My only problem be get it to rise.  I don\\'t think it be a problem with the recipe.  I\\'ve have trouble adapt to make GF breads.  Thank you so much to share this! this bread be so very nice!  the texture be pretty spot on.  even after a couple of day there be no tell tale gluten free chewiness that sometimes accompany bake goods.  it be nice to have toast and sandwich again.  i\\'ll be make this often. Most delicious! Much like french bread. I like the crusty crust. I have 1 problem. It rise perfectly but it shrink in the oven. I only make 1/2 recipe. My yeast be new. I will make it again to see if I can figure it out. Mine bake in 35 minute and brown perfectly, not doughy either. I might try garlic salt next time b/c I don\\'t care for the ricey flavor. I also use 1/2 of each white and brown rice flour and the flax. It would be good for a sub sandwich. I put garlic spread on it-yummy. Excellent!!  The first time I make I do not have a stand mixer and I think to be truly successful in GF bake this be a worthwhile investment.  The first time I could not physically mix the batter into a smooth consistency.  My last two attempt have make my husband a very happy camper.  I also invest in a french bread pan (www.goldaskitchen.com)  here in Canada, and the loaf come out just like regular french bread.  I turn one into garlic bread, and serve to my husband with a bbq steak - he say it be his favorite meal this year!!  The second loaf, he slice a day late and make sandwich - no toast required.  By the third day it be get a little dry out but fine toasted.  I have also make a a loaf of bread, and butter the top after it come out of the oven to tenderize the crust for sandwiches.  Thank you  Gluten Free Girl for an awesome recipe.  (Only substitution be I use the carton egg white rather than whole eggs)  This will become a staple in my new GF Cookbook!! This bread be great!  It remind me a great deal of the Gluten-Free Pantry French Bread mix, though cheap to make. :)  I make roll use some smallish pan that I have and they be really nice, lot of crust. :)  We have them with cheese soup and it be a great pairing! OUTSTANDING!\\r\\n\\r\\nThis be the fine recipe find that incorporate a fine product along with ease of preparation.  I would be will to put this against anyone\\'s recipe.\\r\\n\\r\\nI have be use a standard loaf pan and it have work beautifully.  One batch produce one loaf of bread.\\r\\n\\r\\nThank you. Wonderful when I be miss bread so much! It taste slighty starchy, but overall hit that spot. FANTASTIC- i have newly discover this recipe and now make it every few days.  The best home make gluten free bread!!  I don\\'t add much of the salt and be go to try it in a loaf tin next time.  The recipe split down perfectly....if you can half and egg!!!!! This recipe be great and I like how fast it be to make. I serve this with Recipe #53876. Yum! It freeze wonderfully! I have to say that my husband hat all thing gluten free and have say \"All gluten free thing be terrible!\" That be say he LOVES this bread and keep steal it from me!  It be so good!!  I even make it into small loaf to make sandwich out of.  Also try add spice like thyme, garlic powder and onion powder.  I add all three once and make it really flat and use it a a pizza crust and it be wonderful! UPDATE: Adding the 1 cup cheese to the bread produce a much moist bread, and be delicious! ***Dec 27, 2008/As far a rice bread go, this bread be great! Definitely a vast improvement upon the store-bought stuff. I be experiment the 2nd time around with add 1 cup cheddar, 1 tsp garlic and 1 tsp fresh thyme. For anyone use a breadmachine, this be a 2 lb loaf. Excellent!! This a very stable gluten free bread recipe.  I have make this with garbanzo bean flour and millet flour substitute in part or full for the rice flour and it always make a delicious crusty bread.  I love it with a little olive oil balsamic vinegar. After read all the rave review I have to try this recipe.  I be glad I did!  I have be GF for 8 year and this be one of the good bread I have made; even those that don\\'t have to eat GF enjoy this.  I use brown and white rice flour, make go with just brown next time, either way another great addition to my GF collection. I actually get me a french bread pan just because of this recipe!  It be great toast too!  I use my leftover bread for toast and egg - delicious.  Thanks for the recipe! This get a rave review from my friend that I make it for a the best gluten free bread that she\\'s had!  I think it be great taste a well.  It be the strange bread I\\'ve make since I\\'m use to flour breads--but it turn out great--I\\'d definitely eat it a well and wouldn\\'t miss the flour!!!! I post a question in the Celiac forum for a recipe that didn\\'t have the texture of cake and wasn\\'t sweet.  DH hadn\\'t find any wheat free bread he like plus Celiac SIL be come to visit.  Pammybo give me this link for which I be very grateful.  Celiac SIL wasn\\'t convince because it taste so good, I have to show her the recipe.  DH say it be the tasty wheat free bread he have every had.  I didn\\'t miss wheat bread at all, in fact I think this actually taste better.  The only \"down side\" for my husband be the fact that it be so good he say he could bring out the butter and eat a whole loaf in one sitting.  Absolutely yummy.  Thanks for sharing. I be look for an EASY bread recipe - something straightforward and with common ingredient - and this recipe fit the bill....and be absolutely delicious!   I do a little substitute - I use oat flour (I make my own in a coffee grinder with roll oats, which be excellent) along with sorghum flour (and the tapioca flour) instead of rice flour (I don\\'t like the \\'fried rice\\' taste of bake good make with rice flour....) and be very impress with the results.  The loaves, split down the middle, make excellent sandwiches.  Thanks for a great recipe! this be a very forgive recipe. i\\'ve make it follow the advice of other reviewer - so use brown rice flour instead of one of the cup of white rice flour, potato flour instead of tapioca flour. this mean (imho) that you can be free to flex, use what you have on hand instead of stick to it exactly. i use carol fenster\\'s cookbook advice about use an ice-cream scoop to  \"measure\" out the dough into the french bread form so the loaf come out about the same size. i have toddler and mom, dad and the little one pretty at a loaf and a half the first time i bake it! it will be my bake staple - bread mix be fine, but every now and again, to whip up something this easy and delicious....  the next day, i make the toddler grill cheese on it and that last half-loaf be a goner. Fabulous recipe. Thanks for make my transition to GFree more palatable. I\\'m the SIL of \"Brit in Texas\"  (4/09 review)--she be right! I check the recipe because this be SO GOOD, I didn\\'t believe it could be gluten-free. I\\'ve eat lot of GF product all over the US and Canada, and this be one of my favorites. Thanks for post the recipe, and Thanks, SIL, for make it several time during my stay. Absolutely amazing!! I just turn GF, and this be the only bread I\\'ve try that actually looks, feel and taste like the real thing. Thanks for give me bread back :-) I bake it in a muffin tin for smaller, individual servings. I be not sure what go wrong here.... I use le yest and cook it in my bread machine. It turn out really moist, too moist. So I think I will try again but follow the direction to the T. My daughter be wheat sensitive (triggers migraine and cramps). This recipe taste wonderful and be one of her favorites. I split the dough into two baguette use a baguette loaf pan (very helpful in keep their initial shape). The recipe seem to work well with brown rice flour or a mix of white and brown. Maybe we have not be GF long enough to fully appreciate this recipe a French bread, I make it twice now the first time follow the recipe exactly and make two loaves, the next time I use half brown rice flour and make them in the shape of biscuits, coat them both side with corn meal and they make PERFECT english muffins. Perfect for mini pizza and toast for breakfast, and my son love them for his lunch with PB&J. I will be use this recipe from now on for that purpose. THANK YOU  for post a winner in our GF quest for bread recipes. Darn good! I think the taste come very close to french bread, the texture be a little different, but who cares. It\\'s the close I\\'m gonna get while eat gluten free! Thanks! I will be make this over and over and will make a double batch next time. This be my first attempt at gluten-free bread.  I make it for a friend who be come to dinner!  She really like it so I guess it be a hit!!  Very easy!  Thanks for posting. This be my first time make GF bread, I have cook GF cakes/cookies/flatbreads before.  I be a little worry after stir up the dough- look like it be go to be pancakes, not a loaf of bread!  But after it come out of the oven I be pleasantly surprised.  Not the most amaze taste I\\'ve ever have but still quite good, and it hold together beautifully.  Would make again for special occasions. Fantastic bread, I use it for everything, it be great for sausage stuff at Thanksgiving, make great garlic bread, cheeseburger & panini\\'s\\r\\nthanks for sharing!! I have be make this bread weekly for almost 2 yr now with slight changes.  1 cup white rice, 1 cup brown rice, 3 tsp of grind flax for add fibre, and honey in replace of sugar.  The result be a nice brown bread.  Yesterday, I accidently forget to add the tapioca starch - and it STILL turn out!  It might even be a bite more moist that the original.  I make this single recipe in a loaf pan for slices, muffin top tin for hamburger buns, (both pic be post for viewing) and in a french baker when serve it to guest for dinner. A loaf or french baker require 50mins in the oven, cover with foil 1/2 way through the cooking.  Hamburger bun in 1/2 the post cook time.  \\r\\noriginal review:WOW! This be the close thing to \"real\" bread that I have have in 10 years!  Thank you Gluten Free GIrl for post this GREAT find. I\\'m go to have to take your word for the freeze part because mine didn\\'t last long enough to even try.  I actually like this good than regular French bread and so do DH. Left half a loaf sit out overnight--still good next day.  Wrapped one loaf in foil--still good next day.  Toasted a few slices--perfect.  Getting ready to mix up my second batch--actually go out and buy a new French bread pan since I couldn\\'t find mine.  Didn\\'t add any extra flour. You must try it dip in olive oil with garlic salt and dip spice added.  I can\\'t thank you enough, GlutenFreeGirl. Bread have always be a guilty pleasure, now I don\\'t have to feel guilty - or in pain.  Updated review: I make this bread at least once a week, it be a real staple in my house and be SO tasty!  No one can tell it be gluten free!  I have use potato starch, but prefer tapioca flour, and have find that half and half brown/white rice flour give a nice combination of taste and texture.  When I use Bob\\'s Red Mill brand brown rice flour, I use all brown rice flour (it be more finely ground).  I use three whole egg instead of just whites, substitute canola oil for the butter (and use 3 Tbsp so I don\\'t have to brush the top with butter), and maple syrup for the sugar.  I use apple cider vinegar for the vinegar.  To make sandwich bread, I put the whole recipe worth of dough into a sandwich loaf pan and bake for a little bite longer.  So wonderful!\\n\\nOriginal review: I use brown rice flour and substitute potato starch for the tapioca flour.  I also use maple syrup instead of sugar.  It turn out excellently!  Very good bread, we make ours into two loaf and eat one and a half loaf within half an hour of take it out of the oven!  I\\'ll try it again with the tapioca flour when I get some! Since this be my first foray into the world of gluten-free bakery, I won\\'t rate this but just add a note. Maybe it be because I have just recently go gluten free, but I find this bread be nothing similar to wheat bread. I follow the recipe to the letter (A+ for ease of assembly!) and what I end up with be a very acrid-smelling, spongy bread that taste very much of wet paper.  Not want to toss it, I cub it, toss with oil, Italian season and salt, bake and to make some very lovely croutons. However, a they baked, the pungent, sour smell be more prevalent. I can\\'t imagine what it could have been. Perhaps I be not accustom to gluten free breads, but this just didn\\'t do it for me. This be a fantastic base bread. I make some variation to suit our taste\\n\\nI split the white rice flour to include br. rice flour\\n\\nI use equal amount of honey to replace the sugar\\n\\nI didn\\'t use the egg substitute\\n\\nI reduce the amount of yeast \\n(we be not fan of yeasty bread)\\n\\nI use olive oil instead of butter to get those healthy fat in there :)\\n\\nI use apple cider vinegar\\n\\nI add 1 tbsp grind flax meal to increase iron and fibre content. \\n\\nAll in all it be a fantastic recipe, easy to manipulate and taste a good a it says. I be go to attempt a multi-grain version and will update the review\\n\\nThank you for share this and thank to the reviewer for make it seem appealing! A great addition to the recipe book! For taste, this recipe would get 5 stars!  Excellent flavor.  But for the recipe itself, I have to give it 4 because the measurement be off.  I have to add about a cup of flour-which isn\\'t always a bad thing except I barely have a leftover cup.  I use olive oil instead of butter and it work great.  I\\'m an experience bread maker, so the fact that I have to use extra flour annoy me.  Other than that, pretty yummy. Taste wise, this be the most incredibly wonderful bread for GF.  The chef be correct in say it taste much like the real thing.\\n  I make the mistake of not note that most people need extra flour when I print the recipe out.  I be an experience bread maker but not an experience GF bread maker.  The few thing that I have make have a different texture and density even raw so didn\\'t think to add more flour.\\n  The result be a flat bread instead of a loaf.  I be a bite bum when I saw that but after taste it, be feel good about the time, effort and product that I have use not be wasted.\\nI will try it again and add more flour to get it more like a loaf but do want to say that the mistake be well worth it a I can see how that would be an excellent pizza crust (bake first then top and stick under broiler to melt the cheese) and mean of make Crazy Bread......... which in case you don\\'t know be pizza dough brush with lot of melt butter and garlic and salt.  Baked till crispy and you will think you die and go to heaven. :-)\\nOh Yes, I make it with the Tom Sawyer GF flour and that save have to buy and measure different items.  That flour have it all in it.  I just measure out the total of what the first 3 item were. This be a great gluten free bread.  I can\\'t help but wonder if the people who be add extra flour be unfamiliar with gluten free bread.  Gluten free bread dough will have a different, wet texture than \"normal\" wheat dough.  GF bread dough SHOULD be wet and sticky.  I follow the reciepe exactly and it turn out terrific, though I put the whole thing into a regular loaf pan.  It make a lovely loaf of bread for slicing. After read all the great reviews, I have just bake my first ever loaf of gluten free bread! I be shocked....I mean really shocked....I have never taste gluten free bread so I have nothing to compare it to...this bread have the best flavor ever....thank you thank you thank you soooooo much!! Seriously AMAZING!  I sit back, close my eye and just relish in the moment of have bread in my mouth that FELT normal and TASTED normal!  It slice perfectly, doesn\\'t crumble to bits!  It stay moist over night if you wrap if up!  It be super delish!  Word to bakers: 2 packet of the quick rise yeast do not equal 2 tbls.  Mine didn\\'t rise quite a much a I would have like (it still work wonderfully, though), so use a bite more than 2 packets.  I did, a another review suggested, use 1c brown rice flour and 1c white instead of 2 cup white.  I also add 3tbls of mill flax!  It turn out amazing!  THANK YOU for finally give u NORMAL bread to eat! I try this recipe last night and I must say I be very impressed! I rise beautifully and when I slice it it didn\\'t crumble all over the place. I put some butter on it and just eat it! I couldn\\'t believe I didn\\'t have to toast a loaf that I made! I buy Udi\\'s bread sometimes which doesn\\'t need t be toast btut I find it to be dry than this recipe. This be very moist - not too moist - but it catch me off guard a I\\'m so use to dry bread. The only substitution I make were: olive oil instead of butter and whole egg instead of whites. And I use a loaf pan instead of make french bread - just bake an extra 5 mins. I would like to try some other more fibre-rich flour in the future. Great recipe!! This be the best gluten free bread recipe I have try since go gluten free 6 month ago!  The texture be so much nice than anything I\\'ve tried. It even look like \"real\" bread when it be slice instead of crumbly pound cake like so many other recipe or mixes!  I\\'m go to purchase a french bread pan just for this recipe and use the bread a sub rolls.  I can\\'t wait to be able to eat a sub again!! :)  With this recipe, I make one large loaf and two round roll to use a hamburger buns.  Thanks so much for share this! This be amaze bread!  The first time I make it I be pleasantly surprise by the texture, but find the taste a bite lacking.  I solve the problem by take out 1/2 cup of the white rice flour and replace it with 1/2 cup of sorghum flour (easily find at Whole Foods).  I also use regular yeast instead of fast act and it hasn\\'t make a difference in the outcome.  THANK YOU for this delicious bread. After throw out 2 batch of gluten free bake good this week I decide to try this recipe in my breadmaker.  I be happy to say that it come out wonderfully.  I use the gluten free set and combine all wet ingredient on the bottom, all dry ingredient on the top and let the breadmaker do the rest.  It smell like real bread when it be baking.  It do not rise a much a regular bread but I think that be to be expect with the gluten free.  I do add a tad more flour; about 1/2 cup and I use agave nectar in lieu of the sugar.  I also LOVE the fact that you can make this recipe with affordable gluten free flour a some of the various flour on the market be extremely expensive.  I be happy with this simple go to recipe since I be so new at this gluten free bake thing.  You rock! Thank you so much for this recipe GlutenFreeGirl, this be the first GF bread recipe that be not disgusting.  I have try so many since go GF, and they have all be like a brick. I have also tweeked this by use all brown rice flour instead of white, use 2 whole egg instead of egg white , use olive oil instead of butter, lemon juice instead of vinigar and add in some grind flax seed & grind hemp seeds. I also add in a bite of pure coconut extract & vanilla.  I bake it in a 9x13 loaf pan, cut it in half & freeze half because I can\\'t possibly eat a whold loaf before it go bad. This be the only GF bread recipe that almost taste like real bread.  Thank you so much. I will try the breadmaker some time soon, but haven\\'t have any luck with the breadmaker GF bread yet.  Great job GlutenFreeGirl. Keep post PLEASE!!! This go fast, right out of the oven. I\\'ve make it twice - once stuff with herb (chives, thyme and rosemary) and once plain. Both time there be more non-GF eater than GF ones. Everyone enjoy it. I just use aluminum foil to help shape it into French bread. Is this actually gluten free bread????  OMG, it be amazing!  Even though my bread brown a little too much for my liking, it be by far good than any other gluten free bread I have tried.  I follow the direction but omit the egg substitute because I didn\\'t have any.  Otherwise, direction be follow to a T.   I have two amaze French bread loaves.  Next time I\\'ll try the loaf pan and see if I can make bread for sandwhiches!<br/><br/>Thanks so much for sharing! I LOVE this recipe. It taste so incredible! The only problem I be have be that once it come out of the oven it sinks. Does anyone have any suggestion for how to fix this? I couldn\\'t get it to stay form when I make French bread in the french bread pan. It be so thin. HELP! The people who make guar gum or xanthan gum recommend it be dissolve in the oil/wet mixture before be add to the recipe.  It need the oil or fat to be properly dissolved. Although recipe do work do it the way that the author wrote, it work much good if do the other way and have a good texture.  The guar gum also should not be use in recipe with a high acid content a the acid tend to neutralize it.  The xanthan gum do a good job of combine starches.  See Bob\\'s Red Mill site if you be interest in recommend proportion for different recipes.  <br/>Although the rice and tapioca flour be \\'safe\\' flour with a more neutral taste, I tend to prefer work with combination of other flour  for about a third the flour amount for the increase vitamin and protein that they offer.  Changing the starch can have an effect on the recipe if you be inexperienced in work with these flours. This be the absolute best gluten free bread that I have eaten.  I have be GF for just under a year and I be really start to miss bread.  I try recipe after recipe for bread that be just not there.  I give up try about 2 month ago.  I need bread to make stuff for turkey this one sound good so I try it.  I follow other poster advice, like add more flour, for the first loaf, mistake, it be heavy.  I make it with brown rice and sweet rice flour, use a reduce regular yeast the second, it be good, but yeasty.  But the best way be to make it a written, with the quick rise yeast, I be in heaven when I try it.  <br/><br/>Thank you for this great bread Gluten Free Girl! I love this recipe. I\\'m a new at gluten free food and the taste of bread a be hard to get use to. This bread be by far the close in taste to regular bread. I only use one 8g. quick rise envelope for the recipe and it work well. I don\\'t like the taste and smell of yeast and find that the original recipe be too \"yeasty\" for me. I also use 1c. white and 1c. brown of rice flour. I\\'ve make a loaf a bread, french bread, buns, odd look shape bread, and it all taste really good. Has anybody make this without eggs? My dad be allergic to eggs. I try this recipe today and like one reviewer who say she make the bread in a bread machine so that be what I tried. I end up with a 4\" loaf which be very dense but with good flavor. So next time I will do it the old fashion way and see if I have good results. AMAZING!!  My husband & cousin husband be just diagnose with ciliac. On Christmas Eve we always have spaghetti.  I make this bread so they have something to go with their pasta.  Needless to say, everyone - even the kids, want their bread.  They all think it be good than the Costco bakery bread.  Thank you for such an awesome recipe. ......ended up with what resemble a flat bread. I be go to try it in a loaf pan instead of free form on a bake sheet.  I\\'ll tweek the recipe at home here and see what I can do.  Flavour be good tho... I be not go to rate this but want to give my experience:  I follow the recipe a state expect I use potato starch in place of tapioca because that\\'s what I have AND I leave out the egg substitute because I didn\\'t have it AND I use bake soda and lemon juice instead of yeast. (yeast allergy).  I leave out the vinegar(<< another allergy) a I use the lemon juice.  This be MY FIRST TIME make this bread and it be an epic failure.  I know it be all my fault and I will try and try again until I get it right.  I didn\\'t understand that this be suppose to be a \"goopy\" dough so I add flour and hand knead it for about 5 minutes.  I have read ALL the review but somehow I miss that part.  So, it rise beautifuly, but it never get brown and it be soooo very hard that I can\\'t even cut it with a knife. (maybe a chisle and hammer?)  I didn\\'t let it sit and rise I cook it after mixing.  It \"looks\" absolutely gorgeous but the knead do it in.  I will try again this even and will rate it then.  I\\'m hop maybe the bird will eat it.  I would hate for all that work and dough to go to waste. I have use this recipe to make loaf of bread, pizza crust and slider bun and I must say, this recipe will save my wallet! Each time, the recipe come out perfect, follow it exactly except for the egg substitute. If you bake it in a regular loaf pan, be sure not to let it rise past 20 minutes, or the top will slide when you put it in the oven. I put the dough on a (spray) oil and cornmeal dust pizza stone, pre-baked it for about 10 minutes, and then add sauce and cheese and bake it until the cheese melted, another 10 minutes. And I find a \"whoopie pie\" pan on clearance , scoop some dough into the shallow wells, let it rise and bake it @ 400 F for 15 minutes. Beautiful small buns! So soft on the insides! I highly recommend this recipe for all who be gluten free! Excellent!!!, I do not have tapioca flour but i do have a box of tapioca which be what I used. I have to buy the tapioca flour just to see if there be a difference but I think it turn out great. Only use half the yeast, I think 2 tbsp be too much unless you mean to say 2 tsp which make more sense. Try this one a a bread instead of muffins, http://www.food.com/recipe/gluten-free-sweet-corn-bread-muffins-376155, taste pretty good for a sweet bread. Since my husband be diagnose with celiacs last January, I\\'ve try quite a few gluten free bread recipes.  Most, even when home-made turn out too dry or dense - or simply \\'wrong\\' somehow.  <br/><br/>This bread recipe is, by far, the best french bread recipe I\\'ve found.  I just pull the loaf out of the oven and, while it be still hot, rip of the end.  I be so pleasantly surprise to find the crust nice and crisp, while the center be deliciously chewy.  <br/><br/>I find myself feel somehwhat fortunate never have master bread pre-celiacs - it wouldn\\'t have occur to me that the dough look funny.  I suggest follow it to the letter - there be no complaint from me whatsoever.  Love it.  Thank you!!! I\\'m give this 5 stars, only because it won\\'t let me give 4 1/2.  I follow the recipe exactly, it be a very wet \"dough.\" I expect that. It rise perfectly, even smell like \"real\" bread dough. It brown very nicely, and have a perfect crispness to it. Of course I have to have a piece while it be still warm with butter...I wasn\\'t that impress with the first bite. Initially I think it taste too \"eggy\" and much like french toast, without the cinnamon and sugar. Still be the close thing to regular bread that I have try thus far. I let the loaf cool, then wrap in foil and leave on the counter until the next day (today) when I decide to try it again. It\\'s soooo much good today than yesterday. I\\'m eat it a a sandwich and I can\\'t even tell that it be gluten free. Totally impress now! I will be make this again, but leave it for the next day. I would give this recipe 5 start except for the funky flavor and smell. We make about 3 batch to finally figure out what it be that be cause the weird/off taste. It\\'s the tapioca flour.We originally use apple cider vinegar and olive oil to coat the top. We think maybe our olive oil be rancid. We make another batch with margarine on the top. The funky taste be still there. The third batch we we switch to white distil vinegar, and it be still gross. So we figure it have to be one of the flours. So my husband start smell them and find it be the tapioca. I don\\'t know if our flour be bad or if that be just how it tastes. I\\'ve never notice it taste bad like that in any of the other recipe I\\'ve use it in. Other than that the bread be delicious. It be soft on the inside and have a crisp and slightly chewy crust. If we make it again we be go to substitute the tapioca with potato starch and see if that works. This be pretty good.  It definitely satisfy my crave for sandwich and I didn\\'t want to cave and use regular bread.  I use rice flour and potato starch because that be what I have on hand.  I also use reular yeast.  I put all the ingredient in my bread maker to knead and rise and then put it in the oven to bake.  i might try use the tapioca flour next time.  It taste a little yeasty. I could weep at this moment. <br/><br/>Finally, after 5 long year of waiting, a bread that I can make at home that be egg- dairy- and gluten-free and that ACTUALLY TASTES GOOD! <br/><br/>And it still taste good with the addition of salty tears. <br/><br/>THANK YOU! Seriously the best gluten-free bread I\\'ve ever made.  My boyfriend be a chef and he say he could barely tell the difference.  I make it at 7,000 ft altitude and didn\\'t make any changes, and it turn out just perfect! This recipe be awesome. It taste a lot like French bread; crusty outside and soft fluffy inside. It stay good for about 3 days, long if refrigerated. It freeze well, and you can make breadcrumb for other recipe late on. You really can\\' tell that it\\'s gluten free. Very impressive!<br/>I follow it a written, but simply add 2 whole egg for the egg white/substitute. I use apple cider vinegar (probably most vinegar would work.) I put in in two small greased/cornfloured loaf pan and bake for the recommend time.<br/>Since then, I\\'ve substitute coconut oil for the butter, brown rice flour for the white, and add grind flax seed, and it turn out really well each time.<br/>I haven\\' be brave enough to spread it out on a tray, and don\\'t have a French bread pan, so I\\'ll just continue put it in small loaf pan for now. I\\'m sure you could use large pan or experiment.<br/>It%u2019s a bite yeasty if you cut it right out of the oven; it\\'s good cool or the next day. It toast ok, and be good with peanut butter, jam, dip in soups, ect.<br/>A few tips: You really need a good stand mixer for this recipe. I don\\'t see how you could possibly beat it by hand. The dough be more like a thick batter, but should rise like normal bread dough and bake the same. I let it rise until it almost touch the brim of the bake pans, then brush it with butter near the end of the bake time. I don&#039;t know what go wrong, but my dough spread out flat during the rise stage. I follow the recipe exactly. I bake it a directed, even though it have flatten out, and it bake crispy golden on the outside but too soft/gluey on the inside. Further bake do not improve it. The flavor be good, but we couldn&#039;t really eat it. Sorry. After try several recipes, I keep come back to this one. I have use this recipe a french bread, sub bread (lower temp to 350 and let steam in a plastic bag for about 20 min), pizza crust (add garlic and parsley roll between parchment paper), and now I be about to try burger buns. I want to get more versatile with this recipe because it be the easy and tastiest. Even good than the box that just add water. Any suggestion for a pull apart monkey bread?&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I find that oil up my hand with olive oil or the crisco spray help to shape down the tip that stick up. Oh and one more thing, parchment paper be key. not foil. I admit when I read all the good review I be sceptical. I\\'ve try many other gluten free recipe and they all taste like dense pound cake. I\\'ll admit my bread do not rise too well from cook on a cookie sheet, I think if you be go to bake this bread invest Ina French bread pan. So my bread look a little flat but taste like real French bread. My husband who be not gluten intolerant and have suffer through many of my gluten free recipe take some of this bread to work with him. He end up call me just to tell me how great this bread was. He say we would never have to buy store buy bread again. I think that say it all. Now can someone point me to a recipe for chocolate chip cooky that be like the real gluten contain ones. This be a very good recipe.  I just take this to a family gather with most people be gluten eaters, and everybody love it.  My SIL say this be good than a lot of people regular bread, and she definitely be not a gluten free fan.  I quadruple the recipe and I always make it it regular loaf pans.  I put one recipe which say it make two french bread loaf into one loaf pan and it make a nice high rise regular loaf.  I change the white rice flour to 2 part white rice flour, 3 part brown rice flour, 1 part oat flour, and 2 part sorghum flour.    I think this be the best mixture of flour I have try yet.  I also add 1 tsp flax seed for every tsp egg replacement call for and 2 tsp of water for ever tsp flax seed.  For those new to make gluten free bread, the dough will not be the texture you be use to.  It be VERY sticky...do not add extra flour.  I mix it in my bosch mixture and then pour the batter into my well grease bread pan and smooth it out with a spatula on top to make it a much more even loaf. Hope this helps. This produce a lovely moist, light and fluffly bread.  My husband even say he would consider go gluten free if I replace his bread with this bread. This be one of those recipe that make live gluten free a little bite easy and even pleasant! This recipe be fabulous. I skip the egg substitute. I use egg white in a carton and it work great (about 7 Tbsp. be 3 egg whites). This bread be excellent for garlic bread! This make very good bread. Even my picky gluten eat daughter like them. I\\'m interest to see how it will be the next day. Some GF bread turn very dry and crumbly very quickly. This doesn\\'t seem to be that way, but only time will tell! Meanwhile, very good start.<br/>Update: Lasted three day in my bread box on the counter. Great recipe! Thank you! This bread be amazing! I make no change to the ingredient except to half the recipe, which still work well to mix in my stand mixer. I use plain white vinegar a the recipe didn\\'t specify. The big change I make be bake this in my small 3 quart crock pot. Holy moly! Beautiful crusty brown bread, just like the wheat version. I\\'ll be come back to this recipe many time in the future, especially in the summer month when heat a big oven be too much. This be so good! Taste and texture be great! Only change I make be 2 whole egg instead of 3 egg white and it be amazing! Smells good and BF love it too! I eat it dip in in olive oil and herb and felt like I be at Macaroni Grill.  Probably go to invest in French Bread Pans a I be positive I will be make this again and again. <br/>Thank you! I\\'m not raiting this YET but I will rate it after it\\'s do cooking, consider this be the first time I have ever make this particular bread, let alone any gluten free bread. I\\'m really look forward to it! I do not use the egg substitute a I didn\\'t have any and instead of xanthum gum, I have use guar gum in the recipe a I didn\\'t have any and I do know in a lot of recipe guar gum can be a replacement.. so if it doesn\\'t turn out a well at least I know why LOL I will let ya\\'ll know how it work out once it\\'s do bake :) <br/><br/>And I just want to say thank to all your tip and idea too :) Followed it to a T almost the first time and then tweak it to my like after ward like add cheese to it, etc :) This bread be amazing! I have never make any type of bread from scratch before... I follow the recipe exactly a write and this be so easy! I will be make this a LOT! Even my husband and kid who don\\'t have gluten issue think it be great! THANK YOU! awesome!!!! I absolutlely love this recipe. I also look at the other pictures, and saw that some have make their french bread into sandwich loaves, which be what I&#039;m go to do tomorrow. It be crispy on the outside, and so soft on the inside, and be just so darn tasty that the kiddos and hubby be ask for more. Absolutely the best (and easiest!) bread I have make in four years! I cannot wait to form this into hot dog style bun for sausage and sauerkraut!  Today I form two hamburger style bun pan out of double layered, heavy duty tinfoil (formed over a bowl upside-down) and try 1/2 cup of dough in one and 3/4 cup in the other.  The 1/2 cup be just perfect for small mouth (baked in 20 min.), the 3/4 (baked in 23 min.) would be great for a 1/3 lb. burger or a large appetite!  The rest go into a standard 9 x 5 loaf pan and turn out soft and perfect for garlic bread.  This bread will be bake at least twice a week in my house from now on! I don&#039;t know how this bread recipe get good ratings. I just waste all my ingredients. I mix it just a the recipe say and there have to be a mistake somewhere. Way too wet. I have nothing but a gloppy mess of goo. There be no shape this dough into anything that resemble a loaf of bread. This be one of the tasty bread recipe that I have come across in my search for gluten-free breads. Easy to make although a bite messy with the sticky dough. A small price to pay for some great bread that I can eat. I make herb, garlic, onion, rosemary, bread by just add these ingredient in the last step. You be only limit by your imagination. Give it a try! This bread be excellent. The people here who be post their substitution should post their own recipe if they can&#039;t use or don&#039;t like this one, a many completely change it.  It&#039;s great a is, I have be look for a good french bread recipe for years.Thanks Gluten Free Girl! All I have to say be WOW and THANK YOU!!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;First, I have make several gluten free breads. I make some with a mix (Pamela&#039;s) and I make my own mix or blend of flours. Not overly fond of Pamela&#039;s, it&#039;s too sweet for my taste, but still a good bread mix for other things. I make an artisan bread recipe, it fell in the middle and be very wet and doughy and I cook it the time suggested. I make a french bread recipe, it fell and be doughy, again. I almost give up. I make this recipe today and it ROCKS!!! It be the close thing I have ever come to real, wheat french bread. I can only say that I be in heaven a I eat a meatball sandwich with my own gluten free turkey/chicken meatball and this bread, nobody in my big Italian family would ever know it be gluten free OR that the meatball be gluten free (used one of my fall french bread recipe for gluten free bread crumbs, mix with Italian season and bake in the oven for 10 minutes).&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Now, the only sub I make (I hate it when people substitute and then say the recipe doesn&#039;t work!) be that I use 1 cup of super fine brown rice flour and 1 cup of super fine white rice flour. Everything else be the same. I do not use the egg replacer, not sure why that be in there? &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I bake it in my regular oven in a french bread pan (I have a triple pan, I only use 2 of them and I line it with parchment paper). I bake it for 40 minutes. After 20 minutes, I tent it with Aluminum, a I don&#039;t like a dark crust. PERFECT!!! &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thanks GlutenFreeGirl!&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I do leave the door ajar and didn&#039;t take it out for 5 minute in case it fell, which it do not. I slide it about 20 minute after it come out and it be to die for. Thank you very much for this recipe! My daughter be allergic to gluten. In Poland we have no shop with gluten free product so I have to prepare it by myself . And finally I find great recipe!:) I have make this bread many times, and everyone always love it.  I try make it use spice and asiago cheese,  then sprinkle a generous amount of asiagio cheese on the top before baking, take it to a party, and everyone gobble it up.  &lt;br/&gt;One more thing,  I always put a pan of water on the bottom shelf of the oven before I preheat.&lt;br/&gt;And I spray the inside of the oven with water 3 or 4 time while it be baking.  &lt;br/&gt;My husband say it be the best french bread he have ever tasted. This bread recipe be a winner at our house! My husband say that this make the best sandwich bread (cut horizontally) that he\\'s have in years. He\\'s very picky so this be high praise! WOOOOW! Love it! I make it so I could use it for GF bread pudding, but it almost didn\\'t make it to the second recipe. It\\'s so good! I have make this bread many times! hand down the best ever! I cook mine in small loaf pan they come out perfect each time. This turn out perfectly..had to cook a bite long but still fantastic!! Tip: put parchment paper on the baguette pan and it will be le of a mess than the cornmeal! It\\'s my go to GF bread! I go gf in 1/17. I have yet to find a \\'bread\\' Made this bread love it.I forget the egg replacer It come out any way the best This be by far the best taste GF bread I have ever tasted, and so easy. I do not have egg substitute so omit it and use sweet rice flour. Is this recipe too wet to use a perforate french bread pan? I have horrid vision of the bread drip through the tiny hole in the pan all over my oven! This be the best GF bread recipe I\\'ve tried. Fabulous!! A++ Lorie The be the best GF bread I have make This be a great recipe. The bread be crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Stayed that way for days! I bake in my cloche (received 15 yr ago a a wed gift and never use until now!) and here\\'s the beautiful result. The crust be wonderful and have a nice hollow sound when tapped. Question not good at cook this I will try a have to follow a FODMAP diet any tip lol ?? I like this gluten free French bread even good than regular French bread. I follow the recipe exactly except that I use 2 whole egg instead of 3 egg whites. Somebody on here suggest to use brown rice flour instead of white, but it wouldn\\'t rise, so I\\'m stick with white. I bake it 45 minute at 375 because I have a convection oven and you be suppose to reduce the temperature by 25 degrees. Delicious! Not time consume and so much good than expensive store buy non gluten. I have try to make this recipe 3 time now, and my dough will not rise. What be i do wrong',\n",

I use fresh tomato chop up, probably more then ask for.  I run out of time to use the crockpot, so I simmer on the stave top for a couple of hour or more.  After all the simmer I didn't feel the need to add the butter, flour and more kitchen bouquet.  The flavor be good the texture be lovely.  Thank you for post this heart warm stew. It wasn't exactly the chile colorado that I remember from my childhood in Southern California, but it be quite good, especially after add maybe 1/3 of a small can of jalapeno to give it some heat.  Hubby like it too!  I might cook it again, but then again, maybe I'll test out some of the other versions. We might be live in Southern California, but neither of u have any idea of what Chile Colorado should taste like!

Adding  this one to my weekend meal folder! Tried to adapt this one for the crockpot but may have add too much chicken broth. Very good. I make this for my family of 5, and it wasn't nearly enough food (even after I add a can of beans). I also think it lack complexity and be just a bite too spicy for most of us. It be easy. If I make this again, I would probably completely double it to make enough food. It also take quite a bite of extra time to thicken, but I don't recall how much.\",\n",

Tuna come out bad because of all the moisture (it&#039;s already cooked..), so you will likely waste it unless you salvage for a mediocre tuna sammy.

I want something simple and this definitely be simple and taste like a way more involve dish!  Will definitely make these again and again and again!!  Thanks for sharing!! Delicious!  My sauce come out a bite thick, so I add a splash of mead.  I also throw in a few thin slice of apple and arrange them on top of the meat.  Served over polenta, these pork chop be exquisite! We really like these, but my sauce seem to disappear. Next time I will double it. I also add a little extra brown sugar just to sweeten it a bite more. Good Autumn dinner... thank you. This be such a simple recipe with so so few ingredients, but the taste be outstanding!  I have trouble get the sauce to thicken, so I add about a tablespoon of corn starch mix with water to the sauce.  The end result be a perfectly thick creamy sauce.

I make the recipe a direct except for add 1 saute onion and 2 slice apples. I couldn't get apple cider so I have to use apple juice. I think cider would have add more flavor. Yummy! Next time, I would skip add the juice on the plate when I re-add the chop to the pan, since this water down my perfectly syrupy glaze.

I have half of this immediately after make it and the sour cream jut *made* the dish.. it be delicious. However when I have the rest late I think that the flavour have change quite radically and it have a subtle but pronounce sourness that definiately wasn't there before. If I have only have it *only* late I probably would have rat it 2 or 3 stars, and if I have have all of it immediately I might have give it 5. I decide on 4 star becuase it be excellent if eat immediately and if I need to make this in advance I will mix everything in except the sour cream and add that diectly before eating. That way I can enjoy it at it's very best. Please see my rat system: 4 star for a recipe that work very well indeed if you handle it right. Thanks!\",\n",

Can out great - realize I didn\\'t have the right cheese so I sub colby/jack which be fine (see pic above). Then the next day (today) when I be die to have them again, I take some advice a friend at work give me. She say to do the whole thing in the microwave (put it in a bowl with a plate set on top for a slightly vent seal). It actually work great! So I microwave it for 10 minute - top it with Kraft’s Italian blend and microwave it another minute or two and OH MY! Wonderful! (See the other picture above.)

Used chicken bouillion cub though, and it be kind of salty.  My husband and Company love it, i do microwave it for 5 min first though.... Delicious! What a great way to accompany a grill steak! I prepare Vidalias a direct and set them out on the grill (which take le time than the oven). Yummy!\\n I think next time I will first microwave the onion after cut to partially cook them and then assemble for the grill.

I use 2 tsp of bouillon and about 1/2 Tbsp butter and it be still great.  My onion fell apart when I unwrap it so I will be careful not to cut so far down next time.

The send me home one piece to try, it be the best cake i think i've ever had!!!!!!!!  THANKS Wow!  The tart berry with the sweet creqmy glaze.  Only change I make be to omit the coffee from the glaze.  I use orange juice instead.  Definitely will make this again. i find this recipe very easy to make but i find it to be to sweet if i make it again i would change the ice some Good cake with a nice flavor.  The only reason I&#039;m not give it five star be that it be a very dense and heavy cake and I usually prefer light ones. That say - this be a GREAT recipe for when you&#039;re on blackberry overload. I cut up the blackberry and find there be PLENTY of cake batter for them to disperse in.  So once you&#039;ve eat your share of plain blackberry and have enough blackberry pies, this be great way to use up some blackberry in a recipe where the blackberry be more of an accent rather than up on center stage.\",\n",

I use buy orange juice but the juice look a bite 'thin' a I be pour it, so I add the zest of an orange too. I leave the flavour to develop overnight. When I try it again, I think I'll add the zest a well. Another five star plus from Toni. The two of u scarf down the whole recipe in one night. I only marinate 30 minutes. Otherwise, relatively minor change - use rehydrated dry red chili (soaked in boil water), deseeded and stripped. Used 14 ounce organic tofu (I like the texture good than regular), and halve the canola oil. I wouldn't have halve the sesame oil (due to taste) but I find out I only have half that amount leave when I get home. Might not want to leave that out when you make it, but this be still 5+ star a I make it. If tofu hasn't absorb all of sauce in bake dish (I use 9x13 size to fit) just add to top when serving. With le oil I have no problem with clean up. Wow, what a great recipe to end the Zaar World Tour! Thank you so much. Fantastic combination of flavors!  I cut down on the canola and sesame oil for health's sake, and freeze the tofu for good texture and so it would soak up the marinade better.  The cilantro be an excellent, thai-ish touch, which make this different from most soy-sauce and orange juice base dishes. We absolutely love this!  My kid eat it up with no problem.  I didn't use fresh oj (didn't have orange on hand), I substitute the vinegar for lemon juice and the soy for Braggs and double the recipe.  I serve this with onion basmati rice.  Our family of four gobble it up no problem and enjoy every bite! Definitely make again but plan to use fresh oj and zest.  Thanks for the great recipe! This be great!

I use red wine vinegar, half the oil, double the feta and marinate artichoke (squeezed them of their liquid, but honestly, it wouldn't have be too tart for me if I hadn't). Served with dolmas and baba ganoush. This salad be well enjoyed.\",\n",
       " \" This be great.  I be always look for recipe for cabbage and this one be a keeper.  The mix flavor of the cabbage, pork and potato be wonderful.  I will have to take your word that it taste good a leftover because in my house there have yet to be any. This be super yummy!  A perfect dish for fall.  Thanks for posting. Really good.  I use some leftover pork tenderloin instead of chops, and add another onion to the recipe.  I didn't have cream of celery so I use cream of mushroom soup.  A great winter dish!   I think the recipe turn out just like it should - a nice creamy sauce, bake pork chop and potato and cabbage that taste something like a scallop potato recipe.  My hubby enjoy it and say he'd definately have it another time. Very good recipe!  I didn't have Cream of Celery soup so have to substitute with Cream of Mushroom.  Next time I will use the Celery but we love it even without it.  The left-over cabbage and potato be yummy a a side dish with another meal.  Thanks so much for posting, Kathy228!  M. Joan tasty and tender.  omit onions, salt, pepper.  add rosemary and carrots.  use cream of mushroom and 2 can of evap milk.  Great flavor!!  serve with sugar butter acorn squash. Delicous!  Cooked for New Years day dinner, very easy and comforting. May even be good warm up next day. Will make again. I have this recipe when my kid be little and they love it.  Somehow over the year it get lost.  Thanks so much for bring it back. Followed this recipe exactly. Was the bad food I ever put in my mouth. Threw it out. A fry bologna sandwich would have be better. Used 5 chops, 1/2 a Napa cabbage, cream of asparagus soup with 1/2 and 1/2 not milk. While brown last chop I start onions, take chop out add a can of mushrooms. Finished a direction stated. Yummy!!! Grilled asparagus a a side with no salad. Try it you will like it!\",\n",
       " \" This be wonderful, my first time work with cous cous and it be a hit.  Very light and refresh when serve cold.  For the Salmon I use NurseDi's recipe #67742 #67742 a a marinade and it go very very well with the salad.  We really enjoy this! Great dinner, we really enjoy this, it be so simple and easy to put together, it take no time at all and with wonderful results. I do go a little heavy on the cilantro but when I add the mint to the salad it bring out all the flavours! As for the salmon I just sprinkle it with a little pepper and put them in the oven for about 10 minute at 450 degree then sprinkle both the salad and the salmon with fresh lemon juice. I will definitely be make this again, thanks! I'm not a fan of couscous, but DH is.  I make it for myself cause I saw it be healthy.  And I'm glad I did.  For the couscous salad, I omit the garlic.  I use one large tomato.  Instead of cilantro, I use italian parsley, omit the mint.  I use only 1 tb of olive oil.  It's yummy.  Even DS like it.  I be surprised.  For the salmon I make this recipe : recipe#132655.  It be great together.  Thanks Annacia.  Made for Market tag. Three of u realy enjoy this for tinights dinner, a complete meal.  I make for 3 but scale the couscous size back for 2 serve which be more than enough for 3 of u though I do add some extra vegies in some red finely dice red capsicum and a finely slice red eschallot and I cut the zucchini slice into quarter a I know it be the only way I would get one party (the DM) to eat it (she do other than the rind [wich I leave on]).  For the salmon I have skinless fillet and just saute them in a little oil in a fryin pan.  Thank You Annacia, make for Went To Market.\",\n",
       " ' Yummy dish with much flavor! I omit the curry powder and use a Chef Prudhomme\\'s Blackened Fish Magic.  I use two 6 oz. can of mince white crab (Chicken of the Sea brand).  It work great! My entire family love this!  Oh, I also add some dry parsley and more Blackened Fish Magic to the crumbs.  Easy to put together and very good! Thanks for sharing! A great way to use that inexpensive imitation lobster (or crab).  I cut some fat by decrease the total butter to 4 tbsp and I use skim milk.  My sauce be still creamy and tasty.  I use more curry powder than listed.....it really give a great flavor.  I\\'ll make this again.  Thanx! Very easy and tasty.  Nice and cheap with the fake crab, next time I think I will use real crabmeat.  With the real meat, this would be a really chic dish, almost a \\'crab divan\\'.  I could see this a a first course for a fancy dinner very easily. I omit the curry powder and sub chili powder instead. Easy to make and very filling! I cover the top in garlic and herb breadcrumb and it be an awesome comfort food casserole. Will definitely make it again. Would also like to try it sub chicken for the \"lobster.\" Overall a very good recipe.',\n",
       " \" Great drink! This be very nice after a long aggravate day at work!  Thank you, I love the blend of ingredient here with the spike of liquor.

Although I may have to watch just how many of these I have :P Great refresh coffee beverage! Loved the combo of ingredients. I use vanilla ripple ice cream which in addition to blend in the drink, I also garnish it with a scoop on top.\\nI also cut the recipe into third a it be just myself and a friend indulging!\\nThanks for posting!

       " ' This be a very easy recipe to make and the taste be exceptional!  I do make a few adjustment and it turn out great.  I add chop celery with the veggies, more spice like bay leaf, marjoram, and savory, and omit the peas.  I also use boneless chicken breast because my family doesn\\'t like the taste of chicken thighs, and add about 1 tbsp. of parsley to the dumpling mixture for a little color.  I cook this on high because I be in a hurry and it\\'s a good thing that I do because it take about 5-6 hour for the veggie to be soft. I will definitely add this to my overflow recipe collection.  Thanks Rhonda! :)   What an easy way to make a great meal.  I use 2 can of broth & still could have use more.  Guess I\\'m just use to thin broth.  Will certainly make again.            great recipe! i always use recipe a a starter and wind up add here or adjust there. for this one i want a thick creamy broth so i add a touch of flour to the broth about halfway through. it come out perfect! just thivk enough to melt in your mouth. it be a total hit with the family, and this be not a small bunch, 8 people! and all two thumb up. i think i make too much, but turn out i didnt make enough! A+++++++++++ I\\'ve make this recipe several times, and it\\'s great! My modification - because I can\\'t get my crockpot hot enough to bubble when the lid\\'s open - be to make the dumpling separately in a big pot of chicken broth. I have never make chicken and dumpling before. I Made this yesterday and it be terrific! Only mod be that i chop up a stalk of celery and a medium onion and throw them in the mix. The flavor be great and the dumpling be awesome. I will most definitely be make this again...can\\'t wait for lunch to eat up the leftovers! This be my first time a well with dumpling but mine be not a juicy so I transfer to a skillet and the outcome be amazing.. my family love them sooo much...\\r\\nthanks for not make this so intimidating.. This be really good!  I make a few change though, only because of ingredient I didn\\'t have.  I use oregano instead of the thyme and omit the peas.  The flavor be great!  I over do it a little with the dumplings.  The batter didn\\'t look like enough, to I add more. (Ummm... yeah.. the batter rise - didn\\'t know that :( )  The dumpling take over!  I will follow the recipe good next time when it come to that!  Overall, it be very good and I will be make it again soon! Thanks for posting. I merge this recipe with our favorite stave top chicken and dumpling recipe because I want to try make it in the slow cooker. I omit the potato, add 3 celery ribs, 1 1/2 tsp. garlic powder and one coarsely chop onion and add 1 tbs. poultry season in place of only the thyme. The chicken be do after only 4 hour in my slow cooker and the dish be tasty but we wish the dumpling be a little more dense. Thanks for posting! This be simple and good. I think it be a little heavy on the thyme, but dh like it. I also add onion ad garlic. I use chicken breast which do get a bite dry, will try the thigh next time. Rating this for the flavor.  I have problem with it be to thick after add the bake mix.  I add the dumpling\\'s to the boil mixture but I feel that there wasn\\'t enough liquid in the pot for add dumplings.  Something go wrong somewhere  but it have a good flavor.  I do leave out the thyme and add 1/4tsp of basil in it place. This be soooooo delicious!  My taste bud couldn\\'t believe it!  My crockpot do not get \"bubbling hot\" so I end up transfer to a pot on the stave at the end to do the dumplings.  I didn\\'t add any salt and instead of thyme use basil, rosemary, parsley, and oregano.  I can\\'t wait to make this again!!! I modify this recipe a bite for my 6.5 quart slow cooker. I change the serve to 12, and use a whole 32 box of organic low sodium chicken broth. I didn\\'t have any peas, so I substitute corn and lima bean instead. Otherwise I prepare a the 12 serve change suggested.\\n\\nI make up the ingredient (except for the bean and corn) the night before, then put the crock in the fridge and set it to cook before I leave for work. I let it cook on low for about 9 hours, though I be able to come home on lunch and stir it about halfway through. I add the freeze veggie at that time instead of wait for the end. Once I get home, I turn the crock to high and let it heat up for 15 minutes, then add the dumpling and cook on high for another 25 minutes.\\n\\nThe result be tasty and flavorful, though I might add more in the way of spice next time. Don\\'t skip the dumplings, though! They do a lot to thicken up the broth. Before I add them, I think it be go to be too thin, but afterward it come out just right.\\n\\nSitting in the fridge overnight didn\\'t seem to effect it in the least. I\\'m look forward to the leftovers, since stew like this be usually good the next day. Definitely something I\\'d make again. Over the moon delicious :)\\nMy family\\'s new favorite.Thank you very much for take the time to write it all up and post it.I\\'ve never have that dish before,but it always sound good.You make it easy to understand how it\\'s all put together to perfection! :) It\\'s now go to be a staple in my home.I\\'ve hear it\\'s great leftover...what leftovers,?there go I tell ya gone!!!\\n\\nThank you again :) This be delicious! A great meal for a cold winter day. I use regular chicken thigh with the bone and just take off the skin. I also add more potato and carrot because I want leftover for lunch. Next time I will remove the chicken bone before add the dumplings, but it be great. I\\'m more use to potato dumpling but these be very good! Modified a I always do, This be be woderful. This start out good but when I go to add the dumpling I think 1 1/2 cup seem like a lot of dough and sure enough it take over the pot and by the time they be do there be no broth leave and it be more like sticky chicken and biscuits.  Not sure why I have this problem but I think next time I would leave out the dumpling all together and maybe use noodle instead.  It be just way too biscuity for us. After read the previous reviews, I make some adjustments.  I add an onion, and two stalk of celery to the begin and use chicken breast instead of thighs.  We don\\'t like peas, so I use green bean instead.  I, too, add marjoram, poutlry spice and a bay leaf to the broth to increase flavor.  Based upon a previous suggestion, I add about a TBS each of dry parsley and basil to the bisquit mixture, too.  This be a super easy recipe and it\\'s very tasty with the changes.  I\\'ll be make this again! Very good recipe. I make this on the stave a oppose to the crock pot method due to schedule issues. I like mine to have more \"soupy\" consistency than chunky, so I actually use two can of broth and half of the chicken. Turned out great. Typically I will find at least one dumpling that be chewy, but this time I have nothing but fluffy dumplings. Definitely a good recipe and a keeper for certain. This be really good and so easy. Had to make some modification due to ingredient I have on hand. In place of fresh carrot I use freeze mix vegetable that include the baby pea AND carrots. Used about 1 1/2 pound of boneless skinless chicken breast instead of thighs.  Used half and half instead of milk.  Added 1/2 chop onion and 2 stalk chop celery with the potato. Added sprinke of dry parsley, 1/2 teaspoon poultry season and two bay leave to broth mix. Also double the chicken broth and that seem to be a good amount of liquid to make perfect dumplings. We love this easy chicken and dumpling recipe. I just use boneless skinless chicken breasts.I didn\\'t even cut the chicken up first because after cook in the crock pot it just fall apart anyway.I add an onion to the carrot and potatoes.After I cook the chicken in the crockpot I put it all in a large pot over the stave and add several more can of chicken broth.I then cook the dumpling accord to the box of Bisquick which be 10 minute uncover then 10 minute covered.The dumpling come out so tender and delicious.I do leave the pea out this time because I make a pea salad to go with this.This be the only way I\\'ll make chicken and dumpling from now on..it\\'s so easy and delicious! Oops hit post review too soon, I LOVE this recipe, I always aim for simple and tasty and this fit the bill.  I too make a few change for time\\'s sake, I honestly don\\'t have time or patience for cut up a lot of vegetable and I skip the pea don\\'t like them, use a big freeze bag of stew vegetable that include onions, carrot and potatoes, I too double the chicken broth and still add some water to make sure there be enough liquid to make yummy dumplings.   Its 2 a.m. and I wake up just in time to make the dumpling and be wait for them to be do so I can go back to bed, thank you for the great recipe that have really work well for me. My family enjoy this meal for dinner tonight.  It be the perfect comfort food meal on a cool, rainy day in Western NY.  Like other reviewer of this recipe, I do a lot of \"doctoring\" it up to give it more intense flavor.  I add 1 small chop onion, 1 cleave of mince garlic, 1 tsp. poultry seasoning, 1/2 tsp. marjoram and double the amount of broth.  Like other reviewers, I be afraid the amount of broth indicate would not be enough for the amount of time it would be cooking.  I also omit the dumplings, a DH dislike the texture.  I instead serve it with classic buttermilk biscuits.  It turn out delicious and savory with just the right amount of each essential component of this classic dish.  Thanks for sharing! Super easy and delicious. I double the liquid but the biscuit completely soak up all the broth. If I be to make this again, I would triple the liquid but I think I will search for a different recipe.',\n",
       " ' Yes at it`s BEST! Also add 1/4 cup chop green olive and white wine! Served over orzo. Yummy! Excellent! This recipe be a good example of James Beard\\'s talent for create an elegant dish with a few ingredients. I make 1/2 the recipe add a splash of white wine to the sauce. DH doesn\\'t like caper but chop them make all the difference. The caper blend well with the other ingredient and accent the salmon without overpower the dish. This be so tasty-rich,tender and buttery.  The flavor be so very good and this be a snap to prepare.  Beautiful to look at a well and perfect for company.  For health reasons, I reduce the butter by half and this be no problem. Thank you for an easy and delicious salmon meal.  This will be serve again at our house! Very, very good!  I have fix this in the oven a direct and have also cook the salmon on my Hamilton Beach grill after coat the salmon first with the butter-lemon mixture, then add the caper to the sauce to pour on the salmon.  Great both ways.   Simple, tasty.  Will make again!  Thank you for share this recipe!  LA  good stuff.dee great recipe...will make it at least once a month.  Husband love it.  Very easy to make and great flavor.\\n\\nJudy Terrific!  I make it with salmon fillet rather than steaks, but it didn\\'t seem to matter; the salmon be wonderfully tender.  Loved the flavor of the caper with the lemon.  I put in too much parsley, though -- next time I won\\'t use more than a tablespoon.  Lovely recipe! This be wonderful and be now one of my favorite salmon recipes.  I reduce the amount of sauce to make it low in fat, but I still use all of the caper because they be so wonderful with salmon.  I\\'ve also make this with dill instead of parsley which be also quite good.  Thanks Sharon! This be really good! Didn\\'t change much, except I stick a pat of butter on each steak and then continue to baste during the cook time. Thanks! This be soooo good!! It be easy to make. I bake it at 400 because I didn\\'t want it to bake too fast. The caper and lemon juice go really well with the salmon. I didn\\'t let my salmon cook all the way through because  it get too dry. The salmon be nice and moist and full of flavor. I have it with my Recipe #240456. It make for a great meal. I will definitely be make this again. Thanks for a great recipe Sharon. Absolutely LOVED it!  The I make a thin fillet so I only bake it for 10 mins. and it come out perfect. I love the flavor of the caper and lemon along with the butter.  Made a great sauce for the fish. I make one piece of fish, so I cut the recipe in quarter the best way I could. I could have eat another piece :)  Thanks Sharon for another terrific recipe!  Made for Zaar Stars Tag Game A great, light meal. I also decrease the butter, but it turn out so nicely with the lemon, butter, and capers. My family love it. Served with herbed whole grain rice and organic salad greens.  \\r\\nThanks! WOW! Easy, fast and delicious! My DH love it. I serve it with bake french fry and a green salad with raspberry vinaigrette. I do not use all the butter a some other chef mentioned.Thank you so much for this recipe This be so good.  I do use Tilapia instead of Salmon, but the flavor be what impress me on this recipe.  Loved the Butter lemon sauce.  Will make this one again.  Thanks. Yum! Made this last night for dinner and I do cut the recipe in half be just DH and I but leave the sauce the same amount to put over the salmon and some garlic rice. Loved the flavor of the lemon and caper together. I also add a splash of white wine. Served along with the rice and a green salad and it make a FABULOUS MEAL. Thank you. Made for Think Pink Oct\\'09 Breast Awareness Month. Wonderful! I make this for a dinner party and it be so delicious, moist and super easy! \\r\\nSo few ingredient but such wonderful flavor.\\r\\nI use fillet not steaks, the one extra we cook get split up since everyone want more!\\r\\nSo yummy. This recipe make the moist salmon we\\'ve have in a LONG time!  It be very, very simple -- something I always appreciate when serve fish.  I do add a little white wine to the sauce even though I have plenty of liquid -- I like that little add hint of freshness the wine offers.  I serve another of Sharon\\'s recipe with the salmon -- \"Recipe #155116\".  Made for the cookathon at Kittencalskitchen in memory of Sharon 123\\'s dear husband. I be not go to rate this a I do make some significant changes!  I cut the recipe in half a it be just DH and myself.  I only use 3 T butter...left out the parsley (because DH hat it) and use 2 T capers.  As I have 2 small salmon fillets, these turn out a little over cooked...probably around the 12 to 15 minute mark would have be better.  Just use 3 T butter...I find this very rich, so I couldn\\'t imagine use more butter.  This be a recipe I wouldn\\'t mind play around with...maybe add some wine and a bite of garlic!! Absolutely beautiful recipe for salmon steaks. I make half a batch -- cut back on the butter and use the juice of a lemon and basil in place of parsley, because that be what I have on hand. Capers, which I love so much, be a perfect addition. Served with roast tomatoes, and steam kipfler potato and broccoli. Thanks so much for posting. Delicious! I use salmon fillet but follow a directed, use a bite le butter. thank for share !',\n",
       " \" I agree that this be simple & delicious! I would recommend add about 1/2 tsp Splenda to the sauce a I did-all the pizza sauce recipe I've see have some sweetness to it so I throw some Splenda in. I simmer the chicken with the sauce for close to 25 min but I like my chicken well done! We serve this with some parmesan cheese & plain pasta. I be pretty generous with the mozz cheese (I have to use some up!) & some get in the sauce which make it into a slightly cheesy sauce, which my husband liked! Thanks for such a great recipe!  \",\n",

We always buy these from Tony&#039;s Kitchen in Laurium but now I can make them at home.  The verdict from even the most staunch Tony&#039;s Kitchen customer in my family be that these be marvelous!  I cream cottage cheese in the blender first before add to the dough. I cannot review yet but I be so delight to find this! My grandmother pas away 28 year ago and no one have her prune tart recipe.

We all await anxiously the day she gift u the fruit of her labors. They be absolutely delicious! I follow this recipe and this be the first time I make my own dough too. They turn out great! Some use ricotta instead of cottage cheese but I go with cottage, it be little clumpy in a dough but roll out nice and bake even. I will make these again, everyone love them!!! Wonderful recipe. My only question would be on the yield. I believe it should be around 72 consider the amount of pastry,and bake time. Tarts would be so thick they would not bake in 7-10 minute if you only make 24 from the pastry recipe. Hi, I make christmas cooky in advance.. how long can withstand fresh these tarts?

I do not make this sugar-free.  Plus, I use evap. milk bcz I be out of milk.  I have to pit my freeze cherries!  Used a little honey and Breyer's all natural vanilla ice cream with just a little seltzer to make it blend easier.  I think add more would thin it out too much.  The cherry flavor be a little overpower by the ice cream, I think, so I might add more cherry next time.  The choc. be a crown touch. When make this recipe I be generous with the cherries, & use freeze vanilla yogurt instead of the ice cream! Also use just the half cup of club soda & a bite more chocolate syrup, all for A GREAT TASTING SHAKE that we'd love to have again & again during the hot summer months!

Bonus: the name make my teen and husband crack up and we have a fun dinner! Made for CQ '17. The flavor of the chicken be delicious. We have this with a rice casserole. We have trouble get the sauce to thicken so we just use a little cornstarch to thicken it. I need something to pack for dinner at work, so I make sandwich out of this. I use multi grain flatbread wraps, American cheese, lettuce, pickles, tomato and a little bite of honey chipotle mustard (I warm the wrap/chicken/cheese in the microwave at work, and add all the cold veggie afterwards). For the chicken, I let it marinate overnight before cook it. I didn't have light beer, so I use Modelo instead. Once the chicken be fully cooked, I remove it from the sauce and continue to simmer the sauce for a while to reduce it and thicken it up (didn't want the chicken to get overcooked). Very tasty chicken, and versatile, too! Thanks for post this keeper! Made for CQ 2017 Central America More than 5 stars, please! It be Foolproof and it be Fabulous!

       " \" These be pretty yummy, but I, along with some others think they be a little rich. I think if I be to make them again (they be easy, so I probably will!) I would cut back on the chocolate chips, to 8-10 oz. The cookie part be delicious (and would make great cookies, just a thought!), though it take close to 20 min to get golden brown in my oven. I don't normally have to add time, but it be easy enough to just watch for the color, and it may have just be the brand of dough I used. VERY easy to mix up, and even easy clean up! Thanks for a quick and easy recipe to add to my list of keepers!\",\n",

This recipe be rather serendipitous- not only do it share my screen name, but I have be look for a green bean bhaji recipe. I be NOT joking- it's a though you spy on my Google search this week! :) I didn't use potato, but keep the rest as-is, use a bite more beans. This be completely delicious. 200% fool-proof delicious. Try it- I promise you'll love it! Absolutely yummy. Cooking bean for my family have always be a challenge, but this recipe be a winner. Thanks! Easy and tasty recipe. The only thing that I do differently be to add more chilies and I have a can of french style green bean that I need to use up, so after the potato be tender, I just stir that into the curry. Excellent!\",\n",
       " \" Thanks so much for post this.  The day before thanksgiving I go to get my corn pudding recipe. Lost! Oh no! Then I think of Zaar.  I recognize your recipe a my lose favorite, saved! Note this be more of a solid corn pudding, not a custard type. I usually use le onion and peppers. I think this be really good.  Followed the advice of Deb G and use dry onion since I be out of fresh.  Also use one can cream corn and then just fill the can 3/4 full of freeze corn rather than can kernals.  Diced some sweet red mini pepper and mix those in since I don't like green pepper.  Ok, so I change quite a bit, but it be still really tasty.  My husband didn't like it, but he doesn't like corn pudding, so I wasn't surprised.  I will make this again. I buy some can corn on sale and try this recipe.  DH and I love it.  I only make minor changes:  use all cream corn (1 white and 1 yellow), sub 1 tablespoon dry mince onion for the fresh onion, use Ritz roast veg cracker crumbs, and stir 1/2 stick very soften butter into everything.  I use a 2 quart 8x8 inch casserole dish.\",\n",

DH's cousin and I make this for u this weekend.  We use fresh corn on the cob, kielbasa and apple sausage.  Delicious, I highly recommend it! We make this last night.  It be so  much fun and sooooo good.  I do add a half lemon (rind and all), half an onion, and a red pepper to the mixture.  (This be what my neighbor does.)  We love it.  The amount of old bay be perfect, yummy.  I do add some mussel also, DD's favorite.  Thank you so much for sharing.  DS's favorite part be when I dump it all on the table.....lol. This have to be one of the best recipe I have find for Low Country Boil. I have to change it up just a little and add some Smart Chicken Andoulle Chicken Sausage, Lemon and two beers. The season be perfect and I think that be the hard thing to get right. My family love it! Thank you for posting! This be a very fun family meal, perfect for summer, easy to both cook and clean up afterward. I didn't have any small red potato on hand, so I cut Idaho bake potato in half, width-wise, and let them cook an additional 10 minute before add the rest. Also, I only put the shrimp in for 2 minute -- just long enough for them to turn bright pink. My 10 y/o, who's ordinarily quite picky, ask for seconds. Then thirds! This one's definitely in our regular summer rotation now. thanks, Shawn! i make this a few day ago and everyone love it.  i use 2 lb of shrimp, 1 lb of kielbasa, 6 red potato cut in large chunks, 6 ear of corn break in half, and a little le than 1/2 cup of old bay.  it be very good, and more than enough for 6 adults!  i only cook the shrimp for 2 minute and it be perfect!  thank so much for sharing!\",\n",
       " ' I be not go to rate this yet. I overcook my spaghetti squash which result in extra mushy squash which I think mess up this recipe a tad bit.

Then I wil rate it. But think I would post these note for reference for others. Next time I will try your method of cook squash! Johnney should be commend for  use spaghetti squash in a creative way, one in which could be use on brunch menus, dinner menus, buffet for a special brunch, etc.  I read Liz Ann and decide to read the recipe carefully.

       " ' I make thjis a a treat for my DH and his comment be \"this beat the lamb shank at our local restaurant\". High praise indeed for a very easy to make and delicious meal. Will be a keeper in our our house :) I make this tonight and it be great.  DH ooh and ahhed.  I only have 2 lamb shanks, so I adjust amount via recipezaar.  I flour the shank before browning, use Pinot Noir for the red wine, and strain the juice into one of those gravy separtors before mix in the cornstarch mixture.  I take the shank out of the oven after 2 hour - they seem do to me, and they were.  I\\'m not sure if you have 4 if they would need more cooking.  All in all, an excellent recipe. This be a wonderful, delicious recipe.  Nice and easy - prepare and pop in the oven!\\nDon\\'t forget to add the garlic before it go into the over (this step be miss in the method). Fantastic! Next time I believe I\\'ll use a regular yellow onion instead of the sweet onion I use for most everything. Used a bottle of merlot, and a collection of lamb: one shank, some neck bones, and a couple of shoulder chop (using up stuff from my freezer). Served with roast Yukon Gold potatoes, chunk up, olive oiled, sprinkle with rosemary and a dab of oregano. I\\'ll use this recipe for guests! We have make this recipe on several occasions, and yes you be right it be absolutely delicious.  I can\\'t get enough of the sauce.  Very impressive dinner party recipe and easy to do.  We just love it.  My tip would be to use the best consomme you can find.  We use stock cub once and it wasnt a nice a use a lovely consomme, and always splash out on the wine too, you will not regret it. It be awesome, everyone truly enjoy this mouth water dish.  I use more garlic and beef broth.\\r\\n\\r\\nIt be very flavourful and tender, definitely a make again. I triple this recipe for Christimas dinner party.  Prep time, include brown of lamb shanks, be about 1 1/2 hrs.  I use 3 moderately price bottle of cabernet sauvignon, which seem to work out fine.  However, I find 6 cup of beef bouillon (original recipe X3) to be slightly over powering--changing the flavor of the lamb too much for my taste.  The yellow onion work well a suggest by another reviewer.  I\\'d probably use half a much bouillon next time to strenghten the lamb flavor a bite or add more water which I do with one bake pan.  Also, might try something to sweeten the sauce more like add more brown sugar.  Merot wine go great with this dish if you maintain the lamb flavor, so strong recommendation on this wine combination.  The two lamb shank leftover be good than original--so prepare this a day early be also an option.\\r\\n\\r\\nLoved it.  Thank you. This meal be delicious. I follow your instruction thoroughly and use a Merlot wine. I will definitely make it again. I cook for 7 and it be a real hit! Thank you for sharing. Cooked this for family yesterday and it go down a storm.  The meat fell of the bone and the gravy be absolutely delicious! Easy to do and serve with red cabbage and sweet potato mash, a lovely hearty meal perfect for the cold weather! Will be do again very soon for a dinner party! Yum! yum! I make it this even for my Swedish friend and they love it so much.. it a winner this recipe deserve 5 star.  Thank you! Great recipe! Easy to follow. Tried it last night and it be awesome! Yum! I do not bake it. I use a slow cooker instead and it turn out great! I make this for my family last night and it get rave reviews. The only tip I might add be to use small lamb shark a the flavor be good and cook time slightly less. Also, after cook I strain the juice and veggie from the roast pan and thicken with cornstarch a recipe suggested. The end sauce be a little gray and dull for my taste so I add two large tbsp of tomato paste with the cornstarch and it perk right up. Absolutely banging.. i\\'d go close to 3 hour cook time and finish the sauce at the end with a sploosh of tomato puree and use brown sauce thickner rather than cornflour. serve with creamy mash and green bean Guests love it, thank for a great recipe. Love this recipe, so easy to do and taste fantastic, will try it in the slow cooker next time.',\n",

Also delicious if you sub a box of granulate sugar for the brown sugar (you taste more vanilla & butter, le maple). My only problem be the bar be too thin and sticky to get out of the pan.

       " ' It be good.  I will make extra sauce next time. Finally a Lasagna recipe I like. Made it last nite for supper and everyone like it. Made this last weekend for a special family get together. It be so outstanding. My guest think it deserve more than 5 stars. Really, the best lasagna I have ever eaten. The preparation involve a little time but it be  worth it. This be the best!! WOW!!!  This be absolutely the BEST!!!  I make this tonight for dinner and it be delicious.  My DH have 2 BIG help and he LOVED it!!  Definately something I will make again and again.  I follow the recipie exactly and add just a bite of sugar to the sauce. I always do to tomato sauces.  BRAVO. Oh my goodness sake alive!!! This be without a doubt the best lasagna I have ever tasted. I can\\'t rave about it enough. I love the mixture of grind beef and Italian sausage in the sauce. Rich, and cheesy a well. Thanks I add a 16 oz. package of freeze spinach (thawed) to the cheese mixture (trying to sneak in vegies where I can).  My family love it.  Will definitely make it again. Wow be right...wish I could this a 10 star rating..definitely the best lasagna recipe I have ever tried...don\\'t think I will try any other ones. The only adjustment I make be to add a paste can of water..my sauce up to that point be very thick..thank you for share this wonderful recipe...Carrie Wow and wow again. Hands down the best lasagna I have ever tasted. Beats any that I have try in the numerous Italian restaurant I have eat in. The sauce be meat-filled and very well seasoned. This be so full of cheese which make it rich and delicious. It taste even good the next day. Simply amazing. Thanks Nurse Di. Now this be truly outstanding. Absolute best be right. The sauce be they key. The combination of grind beef and Italian sausage be brilliant. Lots of oregano and basil too. Very rich with cheese too. We LOVED this and believe me, I be spread the word. Thanks for post this. Made this for noon mess today, use about 1/2 cup \\r\\nof fresh parsley insted of dry and it turn \\r\\nout great.  Make sure you let it stand after bake \\r\\nas it be a tad bite runny.  SCMEDIC\\r\\n What can I say that hasn\\'t be said, This be GREAT Lasagna.\\r\\nLove the Combination of meat in the sauce. I use fresh Lasagna noodles. Very Good,I will be use this Recipe when I make Lasagna. Thank you for posting. ;) Absolutely fantastic!  Made this for a dinner party and everyone love it.  I do change a few things: I substitute ricotta for the cottage cheese, use 1 lb. each of hot italian sausage and grind veal, and decrease the salt in the sauce to 1 t., and do not add any to the cheese mixture (added extra parm. instead) I also add a bite more mozzarella a I have some extra. This have such well proportion flavouring; it truly be the absolute best!  Will \"absolutely\" make again! Great recipe for the meatlover. I try the recipe with grind turkey and \"real\" Italian sausage.It come out great but the cheese and meat mix together be too much for us. I would suggest maybe create separate layer ...one for the meat mixture and one for the cheese. I must say though...that this recipe can be easily adaptable to substitute the meat for a melange of veggies...zucchini, mushrooms, green pepper mix in with the tomato sauce. Thanks for the recipe. I use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and it turn out great. Double WOW for this recipe. I make your lasagna for our romantic Valentine\\'s dinner. I use 1 lb. grind beef and 1 lb. Italian sausage, just because we really like Italian sausage. This be a meat-lover\\'s dream come true. The sauce have wonderful Italian flavor and there be a whole lotta cheese which be how we like it. I can\\'t wait to make this again and invite some friend over. Great one. I make your lasagna for our anniversary dinner. What a treat. The sauce be very, very meaty which be how my husband and I like it. Sometimes, at restaurants, it be hard to detect any meat at all in the sauce. Great season and the cheese add a delectible richness. I do recommend let the lasagna sit for about 15-20 minute before serving. Otherwise it be a little runny. I have find that to be true with all the lasagna recipe I have tried. A gem of a recipe. Thanks. This lasagna be good. I think it need more cheese filling, but it be gobble right up! I will make it again, but I think I will \"beef\" up the cheese layer a bit. Thanks NurseDi. YUM! Simply delicious! This will be my family\\'s only lasagna recipe. I do make a few minor change which I be sure do not affect the outcome in the least bit. I use a pound each of sausage and beef and I also substitute half the cottage cheese with ricotta. Knowing me I probably add more garlic, too. My guest all say this lasagna be superb! I\\'ve make similar taste sauces, but what set this recipe apart be the wonderful texture. The lasagne set up beautifully and cut like a dream. I do add a can of tomato paste water. I think the cottage cheese make it more creamy than the ricotta, too. This be sooooooo good - I accidently have put too many garlic clove though - about 15 extra...yikes!!!  I be seriously a novice cook (NEVER COOK unless i have a recipe type) and I think a cleave be the whole garlic thing, I didn\\'t know it be the small thing.  Anyways, we have dinner guest and they raved, but we all have to admit a litttle too much garlic.  Next time I make it I KNOW it\\'ll be out of this world!  OH and to make the meat sauce le runny, we (accidently again...my husband throw the egg in the wrong bowl and we have about 1 egg in the meat sauce instead of cheese sauce) put abotu 1 egg in the meat sauce, it be not runny at all, maybe that\\'s why!! Outstanding. The only change I make be to use 1/2 the cottage cheese amount and add 12 ounce low-fat ricotta cheese for a creamer blend.  The sausage add such a great flavor to the lasagna. Next time, I will omit the sausage and add pepperoni instead. Served it with garlic green beans, side salad and Texas Toast. I do enjoy this recipe the first time I make it, but the second time I add a few things.\\r\\nI add a bell pepper, finely dice to the sauce, and a beef bullion cube for add flavor. I also add a few more clove of garlic also a T of brown sugar. and in the cheese fill I omit the cottage cheese and add ricotta and 1/2 C of shred monterey jack cheese and 2 T of sourcream, a sprinkle or two of garlic powder.\\r\\n Very, very, very good lasagna!  Except for a true Italian dish, you must substitute the cottage cheese for fresh ricotta and ther herb definately have to be fresh.  Nice recipe NurseDi!  Sorry to criticize, but marry to a true italian (1/2 Sicilian & 1/2 Calabres) and would never ever use cottage cheese instead of fresh ricotta.  (Could be head for divorce court if I try to do that!)\\r\\n\\r\\n:) I also use half ricotta and half cottage cheese, a well a 1 lb. of Italian sausage and 1 lb. of grind turkey meat. I throw a bay leaf in the sauce a it simmered.  Good stuff, I have some for breakfast too! This ROCKS, I have make it twice in a 1 1/2 an everyone love it.  I\\'m not a cook, but it be a very simple recipe to follow and I love the meat sauce.  I will use it over spaghetti Absolutely amazing! Thank you for such a wonderful recipe! The only change I make be the addition of slice mushrooms.  This be fantastic.  It serve 4 very hungry adult and 2 of u eat leftover willingly and eagerly for 2 more days.  This be a keeper. Thank you for make me a star at our Italian dinner. I only take a star away from this because my husband find this a little too salty and it be just on the brink for me. Other than that, fabulous! And I must admit that the leftover the next day be better, once the flavour have more of a chance to blend together, and a piece I heat up for lunch after that be even better!It do mellow out, but I personally will cut back on the salt slightly next time, maybe try just 1 1/2 tsps. each in the meat sauce and the cheese mixture. I also will cover next time for the first half of bake a mine end up just a little too brown on top. I really like the addition of the Italian sausage and it be nice and cheesy! Thanks Nurse Di! Wow! This be sooooooo good! I make this for at my dh request for a good lasagna- we also invite friend over to share a well.  Only change I make be to use ricotta, and i use 1 lb grind beef, 1 lb italian sausage. Served it with sourdough bread and a crisp salad. Everyone love it and it be even good the next day!  Thanks so much! Best ever!  Served it at a family gather and everyone love it.\\r\\n\\r\\nI follow the recipe exactly except I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese. Wonderful!  My husband scarf this down fast and it\\'s be great for leftovers!  Definitely something I will make often in the winter. The name be very accurate. This be by far the best lasagna I have tasted. I be throw out my old recipe and replace it with this one. Has load of cheese and the meat sauce be scrumptious. My husband grab me up and kiss me  smack on the lip so I know the effect this have on your husband. If anyone want to mesmerize a man, then just make this. Thanks. My husband say this be the best one I ever made. Was impress with the flavors. Just a bite salty for me, but this will be the one I make from now on. Thanks for the recipe. Very very yummy!  I don\\'t make lasagna very often, but this turn out great.  I didn\\'t use the sausage.  Thanks for sharing. Thanks Nurse Di!  This lasagna be the best.  I\\'ve try several in preparation for a wed & this one get the high rat from my \"taste-testers\"!  I use hot italian sausage but be use mild today for the wedding.  I use only one egg in the cheese mixture without any problems.\\r\\nThanks again, this one\\'s definately a keeper!\\r\\n This be an excellent lasagna! I halve the recipe think it be enough for a family of four, and leftover for me the next day. Bad idea, we finish it in one sitting. Made another and I think it taste even good after a few days, the flavor meld together wonderfully! Fantastic Lasagna.  The flavor be great.  We do add about 1/2 lb. of Provolone, not that it need it but we just have to.  I think next time I make it that I will add an additional can of tomato sauce.  Thanks for the recipe. Very tasty lasagna.  We really enjoy this except I find it a little too salty and I\\'m a salt freak!  Love the combo of cheese and meats...VERY HEARTY!  My husband love lasagna with meat and this certainly wasn\\'t lacking!  I will definitely make again, just cut back a little on the salt. This be passable.  My husband and I both think it taste bland.  After so much time check on the simmer sauce and wait for it to be ready, when I taste the sauce about an hour late  it just taste exactly like what it be \"tomatoes with basil and oregano\" in it.  Too bland for our tastes. I have to add in a lot of other spice and season to get a more robust taste meat sauce.  I use half ricotta and half cottage cheese for the cheese mixture, and overall the lasagna be just...\"ok\".\\r\\n\\r\\nI do like the fact that I be able to cut it without the layer fall apart.\\r\\n  \\r\\nThanks for the sharing, but we probably won\\'t make it again. Sorry...  This be great, awesome taste, I make a little modifications, only use one can tomato paste and I add half a cup of red wine and it be spectacular.  Thanks so much for a nice lasagna recipe, very easy to cut.  Hubby hat cottage cheese, do not tell him it be in here and he do not know at all!!! I don\\'t know how anyone could rate this any low than 5 stars.  This be an excellent lasagna recipe!!  I will definitely have to say that it be the BEST EVER lasagna and the ONLY lasagna I will ever be make again.  My family LOVED that the sauce wasn\\'t too \"tomatoey\" and how VERY cheesy it was.  Thank you SO much!!! I do not find this recipe a mind blow a I think that it would be, but my hubby love it. I think that this be a very nice, very simple recipe that easily adapt to other people\\'s preference (like mushrooms/no mushrooms) and easily feed a crowd. Give this a try and you will not be sorry. I\\'ve make this twice so far and both time it turn out wonderful and taste excellent! The first time I make it with 2 pound of grind beef and leave the sausage out and use ricotta cheese in place of the cottage cheese. The next time I make it I follow your direction exactly. It be really yummy both ways! Thanks NurseDi.... This be delicious! I love the flavor of the sauce, very hearty. It make a lot, so I\\'m go to freeze the leftover for a night I don\\'t feel like cooking. I don\\'t like italian sausage because of the fennel seed in it, so I use basil and garlic sausage and it turn out great. Thanks for the recipe! Made this for dinner last night except use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  Also add about 1/3 cup of cabernet to the sauce.  Husband love it and say it be good than his mother\\'s!  That\\'s say a lot.  Please don\\'t tell her. This be wonderful.  I use a combo of grind beef and lean turkey sausage for the sauce. After one taste of that fabulous sauce, my husband say he could just sit down and eat the entire pot!!!I end up cook extra noodle and some extra sauce and make a regular size tray for my friend who just have a baby. With the leftover noodle and what turn out to be not very much extra sauce, I make a small tray for my husband and I....boy be I glad I did.  I end up add jar sauce to the homemade and layer some baby spinich into the casserole to make it more substantial. It be delicious. I can\\'t wait to make the original recipe again, without have to improvise with the leftover ingredients. I think it will taste even better!!!!  Hubby love lasagna, so when I decide to make it, I want it to be a good one. :) While this be time consuming, it be well worth it.  And besides, what really good lasagna recipe ISN\\'T time consuming? lol  Made this a written.  While I can\\'t guarentee it\\'s the \\'absolute best ever\\', I can say it\\'s good than the restaurant one I\\'ve tried, and currently at the top of my list.  :) Thanks! I prepare this on Monday and be nervous go in since it be my first time make lasagna and my husband doesn\\'t like lasagna (I love it).  It turn out perfectly and the hubby love it a do my neighbor that I treat to dinner. It do taste much good than any I\\'ve taste in restaurants.  Thanks for sharing. The title say it all.  It really be the Absolute Best!!! My husband say to throw out my other Lasagna recipe :)  Can\\'t wait to share this with my friends.  Thanks sooooo much NurseDi for a fantastic recipe. Not the best lasagna ever, but good. I add about 3/4 cup thaw freeze spinach to the cheese mixture, but follow the direction other than that. Will probably make again. Thanks for sharing. Let me just start by say that I can\\'t make lasagna. I don\\'t know what it is, but I could never get it right. Until now! I think this be soo good. It do take a little time, but thats fine by me! What be nice be that I have all ingredient in the house (except the sausage, but we still think it be great). My dh bring some for lunch the next day and his coworkers be drooling! Now they all think I\\'m a great cook, LOL! Thanks NurseDi! Thought this be good, I like the idea of mix cheese with other ingredient instead of totally seperate, but I really think I like use the ricotta better. I will try it again use ricotta and add a tad bite of wine. I love it, and so do the rest of my family. My husband doesn\\'t like ricotta cheese, and I think the cottage cheese taste better.  I make it the night before, and re-heated it the next day.  Thanks for a great recipe. I\\'d never make lasagna before and I decide on this recipe for my first try. It turn out wonderful! My husband have be crave lasagna since he get home from Iraq 2 1/2 week ago and he be so please with the way this turn out! :) I\\'ll definitely be keep this one! In my opinion, the salt content in this make it almost inedible. I cut back on the salt by one teaspoon base on other reviewer\\'s comments, but it be not nearly enough. I would recommend use one teaspoon of salt in the meat mixture and none in the cheese mixture. Lasagna normally get devour in my house, but I end up throw most of this out, which be quite irritate consider how expensive it be to make. My other suggestion would be to definitely let it sit for a half-hour before serving, or it really fall apart.  Utterly and divinely delicous. :) Worth the time and effort to make. My husband and I gobble this up and have incredible leftover for a few days. I\\'ve never love leftover more! Thanks NurseDi, this one be a winner... This be a great lasagna!!  It\\'s fat, gooey and delicious!  Don\\'t let the prep time scare you off!  Once you get the meat/tomato sauce on to simmer, it\\'s an easy fix!  Thanks!! This Recipe be amazing.  A major crow pleas-er.  The direction walk you through every step take any guess work out. I\\'m think about make be at least 2 time a month. The only difference in my homemade lasagna and this one be that I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese.  I absolutely LOVE make this and definitely well worth the effort.  The kitchen always smell so good when the sauce be simmer and I like the grind beef/sausage combination a lot.  :) This recipe be GREAT!! My husband be not really a cheese lover, but for this lasagna, the cheese didn\\'t matter. This be definitely a keeper.  OUTSTANDING lasagna!! This be a new staple in our house! Not too difficult to make, at least it wasn\\'t for me. In other lasagna I\\'ve have before, the cheese mixture in between the layer be always \\'eh\\' and \\'so-so\\' - this be incredible! If it weren\\'t for the egg in it, I would eat it straight by itself!! LOL! Thanks Nurse Di, this be a REAL winner! Great recipe. Takes a little time for preparation, but well worth it. I be nervous about cottage cheese, since I\\'ve always use ricotta, but it be delicious. My family really like this recipe. It will be make often around here. Thank You. Wow!  This be great. My daughter and I make this for a dinner which her new boyfriend attended. He be impress and everyong enjoy it. Left out the sausage, use can spahgetti sauce. Thanks Di! I have to say that this be my first lasagna. I bring it to a friend who just have a baby, she and her husband love it! They be so amaze that it be my first one. This be my new go to Italian dish. I have fail to make a good lasagna until I try this recipe! It\\'s AWESOME! I cut the salt down to 1 teaspoon in the cheese mixture because of the previos reviews. It be still to salty so next time I will omit the salt all together out of the cheese mixture. I also add some brown sugar to the sauce mixture. This be an UNBELIEVABLE recipe. So easy to follow. Thank you NurseDi for this wonderful recipe...I can now make a FANTASTIC lasagna thank to you! \\r\\n\\r\\n12/27 I make it again and omit the salt in the cheese mixture all together and it be PERFECT. I have to tell you NurseDi this be the most wonderful lasagna recipe ever, thank you so much! My young son requsted Lasagna for his Birthday dinner. I be bad about use a recipe and have just make it from my head. He love to cook and want a recipe so decide it be time to follow one. This be the best, I follow the recipe exactly and my family love it. Personally I would cut back a bite on the salt in the sauce and the chees mixture maybe half it but other than that this be fabulous and my family say it be the best Lasagna i have ever made. To u this be average at best..made it for a church social..some like it some didnt.. Unprompted, DH say he like it!  That\\'s high praise indeed.  I whiz the cottage cheese, eggs, pepper, parsley in the food processor to give it a creamy texture--so easy!  Also only simmer for about 15 minutes, but still taste great.  Next time, I\\'m go to try use oven ready noodles, and skip cook the noodles.  That would make this even easier. My Family love this.  I make a couple of changes, though.  I use ricotta chesse instead of cottage cheese.  I also add about 1 1/2 Tbls of sugar.  Instead of of finish off with noodle and cheese, I just put cheese over last layer of meat.  Otherwise, noodle would come out hard with out any sauce. I do not like lasagna. I LOVED this lasagna. Enough said, the rat tell it all. Thank You! I make this on Valentine\\'s Day a a special treat.  Wow, it be delicious!  I follow the recipe exactly a written.  Thanks for the great recipe. This be wonderful.  I\\'ve make this several times, the first time I omit the sausage completely and only use about 1 lb of grind beef. I don\\'t like lasagna real meaty. It turn out wonderful.  The next time I do use about 1/2 lb hot sausage along with the grind beef. Both time it turn out perfectly. I use Barilla no bake noodle and the result be just what I wanted.  Thanks for such an awesome recipes! :o) Very Nice Flavor - the only change I make to the sauce be to add 1/2 Tsp red pepper flake and 1/2c dry red wine. If you use the oven ready lasagne noodles, you can layer it into 2 8x8 dish and freeze one for late use...handy when you\\'re cook for just two people. Thanks NurseDi! My boyfriend and I love this recipe! The only thing I do differently, be I use the noodle that cook in the oven. You save time by not boil them beforehand, and they be much easy to handle! This be just amazing, my husband marry me for my lasagna too, and ours be pretty much the same except I use Ricotta and Cottage cheese together.  We like the HOT italian sausage in ours.  I know that this be just magnificent!  It do take a little while to make (but I normally make about 4 box and freeze it for later), and it\\'s WELL worth it. Lives up to it name - Absolute Best Ever Lasagna. I use fresh lasagna noodle and I follow the recipe exactly. Everyone just love it.\\r\\nThanks for sharing. Absolutely the Best Lasagna Ever....I be at work when my husband call and say we be have company for dinner. With nothing plan I google \"The best lasagna ever\" and this be the recipe that come up first. It be delicious. I read back to one of the comment that say it be bland... They must have have their taste bud removed!!! Great lasagna recipe!! My family and I don\\'t care for cottage cheese or ricotta cheese so we leave that ingredient out; it didn\\'t affect the recipe at all. As others have said, the lasagna should sit for 15-20 minute after it come out of the oven because otherwise it be a little runny. This recipe be definitely a keeper in our \"Great Recipes\" book! Thanks a lot NurseDi! :) The best indeed!  I follow recipe exact, but due to limit time, I use no cook noodle and add a cup of water to the sauce after it simmer for an hour.  Turned out yummy!  Can\\'t wait to make again for company...thx! This lasagna be wonderful!  I make it for several friend & family and everyone rave at how great it was.  The only thing I do different be add 12 oz. of cottage cheese & 12 oz. of ricotta cheese.  Thanks for share this wonderful recipe! BEST lasagna ever be RIGHT! :) this be so good. I substitute ricotta for cottage cheese and might not use whole tomato next time but rather chop or paste, but the taste WAS DIVINE!!! love it! thank nursedi! I\\'ve make this recipe quite a few time now. Its always a super hit! The best recipe for lasagna I\\'ve ever make and now this be the only one I\\'ll make. Thanks for post it! Yes! this be very good.  I even have to cut the simmer time to 30 minutes, use whole wheat lasagna noodles, and use roast crush tomato and it come out fantastic! I make this the other night and it be the \"best ever\".  We love lasagna and have try many.  Its not that we dont like the others but haven\\'t quite find \"the\" one.  Well now we have find \"the\" one.  This be a great taste casserole that i serve with a lettuce salad and garlic bread.  Superb........Stephanie I do not use any grind beef, only 1 lb of Italian sausage. Everything else be exactly the same. My family say it be the best lasagna I have ever made! Thanks for make me look great! Having the leftover for lunch today. No question I will make this again! When I be a kid the local pizza bar make my favourite lasgne, the shop have long sinced closed, but ever since I\\'ve be able to cook I have be search for a lasgne recipe that come close to that same one, My search be finally over!!!! This be 1000 time BETTER than that old lasgne! Thank You so much for share this recipe, My entire family love it. I take the advice from another review and put some thaw freeze spinach thru the cheese mixture and we all love it!!!! I have never really use a recipe for lasagna-- I just put it together, but I have to admit this be much better! Our graduate student son be stay with u this summer.  He comment that it be hard to mess up Lasagna.  Then he taste it.  He eat his word along with your lasagna.  Another great recipe nurse di!! Oops, I forget to review this. I make this for daughter\\'s baptism and it be a big hit. The taste be excellent.  I have try numerous lasagna recipe search for the \"perfect\" one.  This be by far the best I have tried. I prepare this the night before and just pop it into the oven when we get home from Church. good stuff!!!! first time make it and it be a blast!!\\n\\noh I think the lasagna sheet should be cook single sheet at a time..so that it won\\'t stick together...hehe I cook it all at once! Normally i dont really like lasagna but this be amazing, so delicious!\\ni add 1/2 a cup chicken broth when simmer and i omit the sausage, I have also turn it into a spagetti sauce The only lasagna I make! Thanks Ratherbeswimmin!  Seriously,  this be the best I\\'ve ever make and I\\'m VERY picky about lasagna!  I think a lot a lasagna recipe have a sauce that\\'s much too sweet and not cheesy enough .  This be exactly what I be hop for!  For year Iâ€™ve be use Better Homes & Gardens Classic Lasagna recipe think it be the best until  I find this one.   Iâ€™m confuse by those who think this be way too salty.  Maybe they put in a tablespoon instead of a teaspoon.  The only change I make be to add some muenster cheese, just because I like a lot of cheese and I only use two layer of no-bake noodles.  I think simmer the sauce for a long a you recommend be a real key to the taste.  Excellent!  This will be one I will pas on to everyone! This be very delicious, I assemble it on Thursday night, bake it Friday night and enjoy leftover over the weekend! I prefer more sausage than grind beef, so I use 1 pound of sausage and half a pound of grind beef and I think there be plenty of meat and cut down on the salt per other reviewers. I couldn\\'t wait to make this recipe, and I be so glad I finally did.  This be an excellent recipe for Lasagna, and I will definately be save it for future use.  Thanks for share it with u ratherbeswimmin\\'! Do not let the 4-star rat mis-lead you.  I really believe that 5-star review be way too liberally give out on this site.  One almost wish the site would allow for a 4.5 star capability, but I digress....\\n\\nThis be go to replace my current lasagna recipe.  It\\'s really very good.  Like others, I substitute ricota cheese and I do saute\\' some mushroom and some celery and onion together.  I also substitute a 1/4 lb grind veal for an equal amount of grind beef call for.  I believe, for my taste it give it more flavor than it would have had.\\n\\nThe sauce be really, really good.  I didnt expect it to have the depth of flavor that it had.  I would have like more sauce, but that\\'s a personal taste.  \\n\\nI will make this again, for sure. WOW this lasagna be GREAT.  I think the best i\\'ve ever had! By far the best lasagna i\\'ve ever made, this definitely replace any other lasagna recipe I\\'ve used! I have to fully agree with many others, an outstanding recipe. Simmering the meat sauce for the hour make a difference in a lot of the flavor. Don\\'t skip it. \\r\\nI cut out the tomato paste (watching my carbs). I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese. And I use fry zucchini slice instead of noodles. It\\'s even amaze cold! Thank you for a wonderful recipe! I have a Lasagna Party and try out 4 differnt recipe this be rat the best.  Thanks Wondered what have happen to \\'Nurse Di\\'!!!!\\r\\n\\r\\nFixed this tonight for my wife and we both agree, it\\'s wonderful.\\r\\n\\r\\nDue to time restraints, have to cut back to 30 min on the \\'simmer\\' portion of sauce, but be still a tasty a could be. Don\\'t look any further,this be the Best..I do fudge with the recipe alittle..I add 1/2 tsp fennel, 1 tsp Italian season and increase the basil to 1 1/2 tsp.I use 1 pound sweet italian sausage and decrease beef to 3/4 pound.I also use ricotta cheese...Everyone love this lasagna..Laminated this recipe.. Husband like this more than me. I use the Barilla no boil lasagna noodle which I would never do again. The noodle just kind of disappear in the lasagna....you can\\'t even really tell there be noodles. Consistency be different. I think it pretty much wreck it. I would probably make again but would change some thing to our liking. I would cut down on the onion...I think it add too much sweetness in the sauce, for me. I also will probably switch to ricotta instead of cottage cheese. I also use Parmigiano Reggiano which be wonderful if you have never tried. I also change the meat by use a pound total of grind beef and the italian sausage.  I also put approximately a four inch squirt of anchovy paste to add more flavor to sauce. This be a very good lasagna recipe.  It taste like lasagna, though I\\'m not sure I\\'d call it the best I\\'ve ever had.  Still, it have a wonderful flavor and felt a little le heavy than some of the more common varieties. I\\'ll definitely try this recipe again. I have never make a lasagna on my own before and think it\\'d be more complicated. \\r\\nI *loved* the sauce and could happily have just eat that over noodles.\\r\\nMy Husband say this lasagna be good than his Mom\\'s...so Thanks!\\r\\n(4 Stars because I felt it be miss something...though, I couldn\\'t say what. I\\'ll make it again, but play around a little bite with cheese I think) We have this for supper last night and YES, it be absolutely the best lasagna we\\'ve ever had. I have a pretty good one myself, but this have replace it. My family love it! Leftovers tonight! I put this together in the morning before I leave for work and cook it when I get home. It truly be wonderful! Very yummy and easy to follow recipe thanks! I serve this for a Holiday party. Both kid and adult love this. The only comment that I receive be that they want more meat. I didn\\'t use cottage cheese a that\\'s not a favorite in this household. I use a mixture of milk, marscapone and egg instead. It be wonderful! I make a few alterations.  I add more meat a my husband be a meat lover (but don\\'t tell him I use grind turkey in place of grind beef!).  I also add about 8 oz of cabernet sauvignon to the meat mixture before I start simmer a I be worry I might not have enough juice for the additional meat.  The last alteration be a can of mushroom to the meat sauce.  It turn out excellent - it truly be the best lasagna I\\'ve ever made.  Next time I\\'m use all turkey meat a the flavor of the sauce be so good I don\\'t think my husband would notice. UBELEIVABLE!!!! i be not a cook perse but this be the best lasagna i have ever taste much le made..better than my mom\\'s which i always consider the best lol...shhhh dont tell her hehe.my change be half ricotta (cuz i LOVE it!) and the other half of the amount i use cottage cheese, i also add 2 tablespoon of brown sugar (i love sweet pasta), also sub 1lb of turkey insted of 1 1/2 grind beef..next time i think im go to try the sweet italian sausage..curious a to how that would be..thanks for this incredible recipe and make it look like im a season cook!!!! I make this recipe for company the other night and everybody love it. I, personally, usually opt for quick recipe but this recipe be worth the time that it take to put together. I will certainly make it again for company though probably not just for a weeknight dinner. This be pretty good.  I add nutmeg to the cottage cheese which be really nice -- might\\'ve be nice w/ fennel too.  There wasn\\'t enough cheese for the amount of meat call for.  I would double the cheeses/eggs.  Additionally I think the basil quantity should be cut in half.  It make the dish too sweet. OMG! I make this for Christmas dinner and it be a hit! I find the recipe very easy. I make the sauce the night before and use 1.20 lb of grind turkey (couldn\\'t tell, no one noticed) and 1 lb. of Italian sausage. I use half cottage cheese and half ricotta. I add some dry spinach flake to cheese mixture. Added a small can of tomato sauce. I also like the person\\'s idea about add 2 tablespoon of brown sugar. Finally, I use no-boil lasagne noodle for the first time and they come out perfectly. I might try some anise seed next time.\\r\\nYes! I\\'ll definitely do this one again. Thanks, whoever submitted. This recipe be excellent - thank for posting.  I prefer a little more cheese fill so I increase the recipe a bit.  I use a deep lasagna pan and a whole box of noodles.  I use large Italian sausage and brown them separately to dispose of most, not all, of the fat.  Then I chop the sausage in my Cuisinart. We have just finish this for our supper and I have to come in and review it right away.The name be true for sure!I have be use the same Lasagna recipe for quite awhile now but be on the hunt for something better,this be it.The only change I make be to use one can of tomatoes,which be still plenty and I add mushroom and green pepper to the meat sauce.Thanks for such a great recipe! WOW!!!! If there be a good rat than 5 star this recipe would deserve it. The meat sauce be delicious and so easy!!! I take this to a friend house for dinner and expect to bring some home and I come home empty handed, the lasagna be devoured. I make the recipe exactly a it be written. I use a disposable aluminum lasagna tray and it make 4 layer of noodle so it be a deep dish lasagna, and felt like it weigh 10 pounds. Thanks for posting!!!! This lasagna be sooooooo good!  It be my first time make a lasagna and the whole family be floor by how great it was.  I add some fresh basil below the last layer of noodles.  Great recipe thank so much for posting! Yum! My husband say this be the best lasagna he have had!  The only thing I change be to use 1 lb of grind beef and 1 pound of regular sausage.  Thanks for help me finally make an awesome lasagna! Wow!  This WAS the \"Absolute Best Ever Lasagna\"! I follow the recipe exactly, and serve it with a spinach salad and garlic bread.  It be much thick than the lasagna I usually make, and wonderfully meaty and moist.  Thanks for the recipe!  This will be the one I use from now on when I want a great lasagna! I make this lasagna for my inlaws when we be visit them, and we all eat the leftover for 3 days! It be delicious! I too add a bite of spinach to the cheese mixture just to add a bite of color and flavor. It get so many compliments! The title be just right, it be the BEST EVER lasagna!!!  My picky 11 year old wolf it down and ask for seconds.  We have leftover since this recipe make a bunch but they quickly disappeared.  My husband taunt the other teacher at school with it!  Thank you ratherbeswimmin! I\\'m italian a well a have live in Italy so it\\'s hard to please me ;) But this be def. a wonderful recipe and super easy to make! I make two huge pan of this for our Neighborhood Center\\'s Mother\\'s Day celebration and while I didn\\'t actually attend the event, my executive director tell me it be \"exceptional\" and the best lasagna he have ever had.  The resident from the neighborhood mow down on it  and there\\'s hardly any left. I just recently make this for my *first* attempt at lasagna. I make it for my mother in law\\'s birthday and she\\'s a terrific cook so I really need it to turn out. It be TERRIFIC! Thanks for an excellent recipe. Delicious, easy to follow, fantastic. Next time I will use a more spicy sausage perhaps or add a little more basil and oregano because we like thing hot and flavourful but it be great a is. Very, very good. I have never before follow a recipe for lasagna but this time I think I\\'d try. I be so glad I did. I use grind buffalo rather than beef and sausage and cook the noodle extremely al dente. Thx ratherbeswimmin! I make this last night for company...it be wonderful, and it hold up great when you cut into it...I have a lasagna that the layer fall apart when you cut into it....I do use ricotta instead of cottage cheese This make a great hearty lasagna. My husband (who be Italian) have serious doubt about my ability to make an \\'authentic\\' lasagna. He love all of the meat! I, think the key be the quick fresh tomato sauce. I, the le carniverous of the duo think this would be excellent with the meat halved, and some spinach, zuch, and mushroom add in! I hate to give this only 3 star but it just wasn\\'t great to us. There be too much meat and we all agree that it taste more \"frozen dinner\" than homemade. To be fair though, I be Italian and grow up eat my grandmother\\'s VERY labor intensive, homemade down to the noodles, lasagna. This just didn\\'t taste a fresh or authentic to me. BUT, it be quick and easy so I will probably make it again with the follow adjustments: half the meat, double the garlic, fresh tomato instead of canned, and I\\'ll add more pepper. This lasagna get rave review every time I make it.  I substitute ricotta for half the cottage cheese, add a bite of red wine to the sauce, and a small can of slice black olive to the sauce a well. Good basic lasagna recipe.  I however find it a little dry.  I end up add more sauce, but that be a personal preference of my family.  I use 1 lb ham burger and 1 lb sausage.  I also adjust the sauce season to taste.  Finally, give the concern others have on the salt content I do not salt the sauce or meat, but do add salt to the cheese mix.  I bake half right away and place a second small pan in the freezer for later. My boyfriend say this be good than his mother\\'s, who be a fabulous cook and hard to compete with! Thanks! You make me look like a MASTER CHEF!  \\n\\nI follow the direction to a T, with 2 exceptions.  I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage cheese.  I also use 2 tbsp of Italian Seasoning.\\n\\nNext time I will add some dry chili flake to give it some heat.\\n\\nMy DH say it be the best lasagna he ever eaten. Thank you so much for this awesome recipe!  I prepare it for a church fellowship meal for about 50 or so.  Everyone rave over it and request the recipe.  Definitely a keeper.  I make no changes, just multiply the recipe to fee a crowd :) Excellent recipe! My DH love it! I use a little le meat because it be all I had. I also use 2t each of the herbs. Thanks for a great recipe! OMG this be the best lasagna we have ever had.  My DH say this be the recipe he have always want to make.  He say if your DH hadn\\'t marry you for this recipe, he would have!  THANK YOU for this recipe, I will always use this for spaghetti sauce and every other pasta sauce. I have a lasagna recipe that I SWEAR by, so it be hard for me to try something else. I be so glad I did! This be absoloutly amazing, we have be eat leftover the past two days! I use ricotta cheese, because the store didnt seem to have cottage and it be great. I didnt use a much parsley, mainly because it be fresh and I didnt have time to chop it finely. Thank you for the great recipe, It\\'s definitely a keeper!!!! I love to order lasagna when we go out to eat just because I be too lazy to make my own.  I be glad my BF beg me for homemade lasagna this week since this be absolutely delicious.  From the tasty and meaty sauce to the way it cut like a dream... this be a 5 star recipe all the way.  My BF doesn\\'t like Italian sausage but when it be mix in with the grind beef... it just make the sauce tasty than if it have be all beef.  I do add in just a tad more can tomato ( just because they be in the fridge and need to be use up)  and love the fact that it make the lasagna a little \"saucier\" which be what we like.  I use 15 oz of ricotta and the remainder cottage cheese because the store have it on sale...  great combo.  I top it with whole milk mozzarella that I slice thinly... so stringy and gooey delicious.  Thanks for a keeper!!! So, I be begin to notice that almost all of my favorite recipe on this website have \"ratherbeswimmin\" a the author.  At first, it be honestly a coincidence (as in this case) but now I actually seek them out.  You really have a knack for this!  As far a the recipe, this be BY FAR the best lasagna I\\'ve ever had.  It\\'s a perfect blend of gooey cheese and a flavorful, thick meat sauce.  It hold up beautifully after cut and it taste awesome.  I didn\\'t have time to let mine simmer for the entire hour and it be still great.  I can\\'t imagine how good it will be when I make it correctly.  Thanks for the recipe!!! This be fantastic! I add a small can of olive to the sauce. It come out great! It be very easy & very tasty. Thank you! This be my 2nd attempt at make lasagna and it come out wonderfully. I dont care for the taste of ricotta cheese and please that this recipe didnt include that. Thanks!! Oh my chubby thighs!! This be the BEST lasagna I have EVER had. No kidding! I didn\\'t make a single change--why mess with perfection! My husband tell me he\\'d divorce me and marry you to keep eat this and that be HUGE because we be in wed bliss. This be excellent. I make it with 2 lb of grind turkey breast and some pasta sauce to cut down on the time needed. Definitely the best home-made lasagna that I have make to date, but Italian cook isn\\'t necessarily my forte.  This be really good, but not quite on the same plateau a couple of my favorite Italian restaurants.  We still enjoy this nonetheless.  Thanks for sharing! We make this tonight and sadly it wasn\\'t the best we\\'ve ever have by far. The cottage cheese didn\\'t quite fit and we think ricotta would be much better. The pork sausage be very fatty and next time we\\'ll just use beef. Otherwise it be still tasty, just not a 5 I think it be a good basic lasagna recipe that be good then the \"back of the box\" version I usually make. This be definitely a dish I would feel comfortable make for guest a I don\\'t have a whole lot of confidence in my cook skill yet! Awesome lasagna!  I like alone so I freeze most of it.  To help prevent the noodle from become soggy  after reheat or the dish be runny I only cook them half way before put them in the lasagna.  They soak up the juice while cook & come out perfect every time! Thought it be decent.  The sauce be very meaty, but seem to lack the rich saucy flavor that I like. This be pretty good! I usually make meatless spinach lasagna but this be good for a change. I like the flavor of the Italian sausage. I will make this again, although next time I will probably use ricotta instead of cottage cheese because I like the texture better, and use a little le meat. We think this be really delicious.  I follow the recipe exactly (only halve it).  The only thing I will change next time be to add more tomatoes.  We want (for our tastes) a little more sauce in the lasagna.  Really delicious, though!  Thanks! The name be not joking, it really be the best ever!  It be well worth the time & effort to make.  Next time I will make a big batch so I can stick some in the freezer. Thank you so much for this recipe. I will not rate it though because it wouldn\\'t be fair. Quite a bite of \"tweaking\" go on and I don\\'t think mine be too much like yours. But I love it!\\r\\nSnuck in 2 cup of cub zucchini into the meat mixture and 4 cup of fresh spinach, wilt and well drain into the cheese mixture. Also greatly reduce the cheese to make it low calorie. I succeed in get it down to 350 cals per serve so that be say something. We love it ! My daughter think it be good than grandmas. Being a single dad, if i can make this, anyone can! I know i\\'ll be use this recipe again. Fantastic. My first attempt at lasagna and it be super easy. The only problem I have (and this may be specific to me and the SO) be we both get a bite of heartburn after. Next time I make it I will be add a bite of sugar to the meat/sauce mix to balance out all the acid. I have use the same recipe for lasagna for over 40 years.  I be never really thrill with the flavor or appearance but my family and friend love it.  My DD ask me to make lasagna for her 35th birthday.  I want to try this recipe to try it out.  I did\\'t tell her it be a different recipe until dinner be almost over and everyone be rave about it.  It go over with nothing but compliments.  I do use one 12 oz ricotta and one 12 oz large curd cottage cheese and extra mozarella (being from Wisconsin and live near a cheese factory have it perks).  In taste and appearance this lasagna rules! I love this recipe use cottage cheese instead of ricotta cheese. This lasagna have enough four/five star review to try at least once, if not more often.  The basic meat sauce/cheese mixture be very tasty, and a other reviewers\\' personal addition testify, the recipe be also very adaptable.  The absolute best?  I\\'m not so sure about that, but it be good and easy. I have make this recipe a few time now and haven\\'t review it yet.  This be the best lasagna recipe I have ever tried.  Tonight I make the sauce for tomorrow and realize that this make the best spaghetti sauce also.  I be go to have to make more sauce because I turn the sauce into spaghetti and we eat most of it.  Thank you for the recipe. It be OUTSTANDING!!!!! I have make this Lasagna so many time and can\\'t believe I haven\\'t rat it before now. 5+ star for sure. It be by far my favorite meat lasagna. It be full of flavor and not too hard to make. Thanks for posting. Oops - I rat a microwave lasagna that I use to get a sense of how long to cook in microwave instead of oven! This be the best lasagna I have ever make - I be not really fond of lasagna but my husband and I both enjoy this very much.  I increase tomato to match the additional meat I use and add some hot pepper flake and about 1 tblsp of Italian season blend. I also have leftover meat sauce that I look forward to serve over pasta. I make this last night and wow, be it amazing.  I add more garlic to the meat a well a to the cheese mixture. More fresh pepper.   I add spinach and fresh basil  to the dish.  Added tobasco to the meat and to the cheese mixture a well for a bite of magic.  Every single person eat at least two helpings.  My uncle never clear his plate I\\'ve be search for the perfect lasagna recipe for year and this still wasn\\'t it.  My husband think it be \"good\" and I rate it a mediocre.  I think it just need more of something...I add more garlic and a little sugar and I use ricotta cheese.  If I make it again I\\'ll try cottage cheese.  I would like it to be much juicier...mine be dry. Today be my husband\\'s gramma\\'s 86th b-day and my mother-in-law make lasagna every year for her. This year she lose her recipe and ask me to find something for her online. This be the close one to her\\'s and we all decide that it be way good then the one she always made... even my mother-in-law reluctantly agreed. To let everyone know she do exactly everything the recipe tell her to do.  WOW it be AWESOME!! Very Good!  Thanks! Loved the difference the addition of sausage and cottage cheese make to this dish. Had to use the sausage available to me - Spanish Chorizo - quite spicy - taste great! Per personal preference, will add undrained, chop tomato late in the cook process to retain more of the liquid - although the long simmer time definitely develop the flavour more - maybe I\\'ll just add a little more tomato juice - Ready to continue experimening with this very tasty dish! Thank you. This be the first lasagna that I have make that \\'stood up\\'.  I do however, add 2 can of tomato sauce and use can of dice tomato v the whole tomatoes, just for ease of put it together.  After cook I simmer in the crockpot for 2 hours.  I choose ricotta cheese and we all love it.  Thx 4 share :) My husband say to me on Wednesday morning, \"Oh, by the way, I volunteer you to make a lasagna for my work.  We\\'re have a Thanksgiving dinner.\"  Anyway, I go right to Zaar and look up the best lasagna rat recipe and I decide on this one.  Needless to say, the dish come home totally empty from his work.  I want a piece of the leftover for another picture, but nothing left.  I just want to make a few notes, more for myself for next time than anything else:  I use 1 pound of extra lean grind beef and 1 pound of Bob Evans Zesty Hot Sausage Roll, 1 cup of chop freeze onion from a bag, about 2 heap tablespoon of mince garlic from a jar, 24 ounce ricotta cheese instead of the cottage cheese a that\\'s what the hubby ask me for, reduce fat grate parmesan cheese and a 1 pound box of lasagna noodles.  Thanks for post such a fantasic recipe that I know I will use again and again... Yummy, all i will do different next time be low the meat amount slightly and do more of the riccotta mixture, but thats just because we\\'re cheese freak over here. This really be the absolute best ever. My picky husband love it! I didn\\'t use sausage and instead use all grind turkey. Very good =) Loved it Di!!!!!! Was soooo very good and really rather easy! This lasagna be amaze the only thing I do different be use no boil noodle and put a little white sauce ontop of the ricotta layer.  It be truly awesome! Great recipe! I do make some changes. I can\\'t bring myself to leave the fat from beef in recipes. So, I drain the meet before the second step. To make up for lose liquid, I add one 14oz can of tomato sauce and two tomato paste can of water. I also like my cheese mixture to have more flavor I add a teaspoon of oregano and basil. It be perfect, and not at all runny like previous user claimed. Will definitely use again and again! Made this last week and it turn out nice.  Made exactly a write and do not have a problem with be runny. I do use mozzarella slice on top. Thanks for posting! Great!  DD say it be the best lasagna I ever made.  I use 1 sm can of fire-roasted tomato and 1 of dice tomatoes.  Used the cottage cheese, a that what my family like the best.  Tx for the recipe. I make this back in June and the title speak for itself. It make a lot, I mean, A LOT. I be sad we could not eat it all. Anyway, I blend my beef and sausage together in my Magic Bullet and that be really good. Do not  resist add olive oil or sprinkle some over the top, I can\\'t help it cause I loooove olive oil. This stuff turn out good than any resturant. This be an amaze lasagna, and I get nothing but compliment about it.  I use the no boil noodles, although I wasn\\'t sure I should, but it turn out fabulous.  I let the sauce simmer most of the day, and use fresh mozzerella.  FABULOUSO!! Delicious! I really like this particular recipe because the consistency be perfect--not too runny like so many other recipe I\\'ve try before. Thanks!! Truly the BEST EVER!  I use 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta - it be delish!  Also opt not to use the whole tomato but rather 1 can of tomatoe sauce and 1 can of water.  Turned out perfect!\\r\\n\\r\\nthanks for a new favorite! Wow!  This really be the best lasagna recipe I\\'ve ever tried!  I didn\\'t buy enough ricotta cheese and it still taste great - can\\'t imagine how it would have turn out with MORE cheesy goodness.  \\n\\nI make two small lasagna - one for dinner, one for the freezer.  Definitely go to make this again.  Thanks for the recipe, Carmenskitchen! Very good recipe.  I add spinach to it and leave out the sausage.  I will use this recipe from now on when I want a meaty lasagna. This lasagna be good, but by far not the best I have ever had.  I think the sauce be a little runny after only cook it for 1 hour.  I would advise cook it long also for the herb to blend, so the flavor can mix.  I\\'m not sure it\\'s really worth the time and energy it take to make this, never mind the expense!  6 of u agree it\\'s just an average lasagna and it\\'s on the same line a Stouffer\\'s, and with Stouffer\\'s there be NO work! Very good lasagne recipe.  I don\\'t have a lasagne pan so I use a 9x13 pan. It take 9 lasagne noodles.  I use 15 oz ricotta and 8oz cottage cheese. I have some cheese mixture leave over. In the meat mixture, I only use 1 can of whole tomatoes, my preference, and 1 can of tomatoe paste because that\\'s all I had. I add a can of tomatoe sauce. I will make this again in the future. Thanks for posting. This recipe be great.  I use 1/2 riccota and 1/2 cottage cheese. Ill say Best Ever Lasagna! Made it with half Italian sausage (minus the casing) and half mince. Used ricotta cheese. Was creamy and beautiful. My mother, who isn\\'t a \"believer\" in recipes, have to eat her word after try this. Definately one to impress the flatmate with..! It be very time consume but well worth the effort. (I prefer 30 minute wonders) My brother in law be visit and eat leftover for two day straight. I use grind bison and bison sausage instead of Italian and beef. YUMMY!!!! Terrific and worth the extra work. I use one pound each of hamburger and Italian sausage. Will use all sausage next time. Good comfort food and fill the spot. Plenty of leftovers, too. Can\\'t wait to eat it the second time around. Terrific recipe!  I do a few changes.  First off I double the recipe to make 2 pans.  I use 2- 28oz can dice tomato and 1- 28oz can tomato sauce 1 6 oz can paste.  I season with dry \"spagehetti seasoning\" instead of use all of the individual herbs.  I also use 3/4 ricotta and 1/4 cottage cheese.  This recipe be truly the best ever lasagna.  My brother-in-law aka \"food snob\" be over for dinner and he say and I quote \"This be the best lasagna I have ever eaten!\"  Thanks for make me look like an amaze cook. this be very very good very good flavor make the kitchen smell good when make thnaks for share This be the best lasagna!  Everyone love it!  Thanks for a recipe I will be use for year to come. I have always use jar sauce for my lasagna...not anymore! This be fantastic! I don\\'t know what else to say, the best lasagna I have ever had! Well here\\'s my 2 cent worth for a five star.  I purchase my ingredient before find a recipe so I didn\\'t have any Italian sausage. I cut back slightly on the onion because of the quantity of meat that I be using.  My sauce be lack flavour and then I notice I buy tomato sauce with no salt!!  So I have to add some extra salt.  I also add approx. 1 tbsp brown sugar to sweeten it up and throw in a splash of red wine. I know I be get brave. I be short a tbsp parsley when it come to the cheese mixture but all in all this be one excellent recipe.  I get rave review from everyone especially my SIL since she request this for her birthday dinner.  I know this be go to be the lasagna recipe of choice next time I make it.  I can\\'t wait to try it with the Italian sausage. What a perfect lasagna!  I follow the recipe exactly except I only use grind beef - I didn\\'t have any sausage.  I be amaze at how nicely the lasagna slice into pieces!  FABULOUS!  Thanks! I didn\\'t think it be possible, but this recipe be so good that it now replace my mother\\'s in my \"everyday favorites\" cookbook.  We use Cottage Cheese....and I WAS go to take a picture, but it be gobble up too fast.  I really think you need to use Italian sausage because it add such a great dimension to the flavors.  Great job!! This be absolutely the best lasagna!! I use all sausage and add an extra egg to the cottage cheese mixture. Baked it almost an hour because we make it the night before. It set up quickly and we be able to cut perfect pieces. Everyone rave about it. Thanks for share your recipe with us. Fantastic!  Very meaty lasagna.  I use grind turkey instead of grind beef and whole wheat noodles, but otherwise keep everything the same.  All seven people at our dinner (4 adult and 3 kids) rave about the delicious lasagna.  We serve it with a big Caesar salad and Garlic Bubble Bread #21547.  Yum! I have only make lasagna 2x use a totally diff recipe (w bell pepper, mushroom & le cheese), and in comparisson this be waayy better. Used smoke turkey sausage, couldnt find Italian, taste wonderful. After read review my other change were: 1lb grind beef, 4 garlic cloves, use mostly cottage cheese, a little ricotta but w no parsley, 2Tbs of mayo & 1 egg.  My po future change would be to replace whole tomato w diced, use all cottage cheese & add 2Tbs of brown sugar to meat sauce. Overall it come out delicious. A very tasteful, fill meal. And I only simmer for 35 min (was hungry). I plan to make this again and again. Thanks for sharing. JESUS keep you. This be an awesome lasagna and I will be use this lasagna a my main recipe.  I use 2 can of dice tomato instead of whole, but my son could still see the chunk of tomato.  Next time I will just puree the tomato and solve that problem.  I also add about 2 to 3 Tbsp. of brown sugar to the sauce, just to sweeten it a bit.  It be delicious.  I also make this with the garlic bubble bread and it be a perfect match. Thanks for the recipe!! Came out well and would make again.  Used chicken sausage and le than a pound (.8) and it be more than enough for us.  I love it with the cottage cheese.  It make enough for our fam of 4 for a few dinners! Seriously IS the best lasagna ever! I use 1 lb Italian sausage and 1 lb hamburger meat and it be great. I will also never buy spaghetti sauce again- this be so good and so easy. I add a little sugar and extra garlic to the sauce, and I use ricotta in the cheese filling. Thanks for the GREAT recipe! We absolutely love this lasagna. I have a nice recipe and while it\\'s very good, it\\'s sloppy and doesn\\'t hold together very well. THIS one, however, hold together and be perfect. I will unashamedly admit that I have the leftover for breakfast this morning. :) scrumptious and easy recipe! this be my 1st time make lasagna and it come out perfect. i add fresh slice mushroom and a couple dash of tabasco. this last the hubby and me for a wk and leftover be always tasty. thank for the recipe! We love it!  I have make this quite a few time now with different variations. I prefer it with cottage cheese.  I love the sauce too but I have to admit  that I\\'ve use jar sauce when I\\'m limit on time but I add the herb to freshen the flavor!  I have also use the no bake noodle with good result - you just have to be sure that the noodle be completely cover with the sauce.  Thanks! Delicious and so easy to make.  I tweak by brown the sausage separately and then crumble into the grind beef mixture.  I also add garlic powder to same.  I\\'m not a fan of ricotta or cottage cheese, so I reduce the ricotta cheese to 15 oz.. I make two small pan and be freeze one.  Great recipe!  REVISION:  I\\'ve now make this lasagna several time with ricotta, and then with cottage cheese and prefer the cottage cheese!  Not overpower at all, although I still use only 15-18 oz. of cottage cheese instead of the amount recommended.  I make this recipe at least once a month. :) Raves from the family. I add mushrooms, but otherwise make exactly a stated. Perfect consistency, delicious flavour. Highly recommend Will definately make again! Love it. Love it.\\r\\nThis be a keeper. Fantastic. I\\'m vegetarian, so I swap the grind beef for Morningstar\\'s Recipe Crumbles, and the sausage for Tofurkey\\'s Italian Sausage. We\\'ve make this twice now, once with lasagna noodles, once with zucchini strips, and it be fabulous both times! The meat/tomato mixture on it own would be a great on spaghetti! Excellant!!  This be easy and feed my family for three days!! I make with ricotta and cottage combine and leave everthing else the same.  The top layer do get a little hard but it didn\\'t bother me any!!  Thanks!! This be the first time I ever make lasagna, and it be definitely a big hit! We eat it for 3 nights! This will be my go-to recipe for the holidays!! Very good.  I use a lb. of sausage and add about a cup of dice mushroom & a cup of squash & 1/2 cup total of dice carrots/celery, to amp up the veggie quotient. Loved the sauce. Easy and taste great. I use le cottage cheese and meat, just because that be what my family be use to. The only thing I would do different in the future would be to use a little le salt in the sauce. It be to tad too salty for me. Thank you for share this. It be sure to become a regular in my kitchen. This be VERY good! I do cut back consierably on the meat- I do about 1/2 lb of grind beef and 1/2 lb of sausage and then add most of a container of chop mushroom in place of the miss meat. I also add 2 red jalapeno\\'s. Otherwise, I follow the direction & amount exactly, and the result be great. Oh, I also add more salt, we like salt, maybe too much. Only thing I would do different next time be to add some hot red pepper flakes, only because we like thing really spicy. Thanks so much for post this recipe. Ok so like my mom, I use to make lasagna with sauce from a jar.  Well never again.  This Lasagna be out of this world! and despite lot of ingredient it be very easy.  I use no boil Lasagna noodle for the first time.  I definitely will get the one you boil next time.  I have some sauce leave over and have it over spaghetti the next day. My mother make the best lasagna in the world.  She have be dead for the last 30 year and the recipe go with her.  This recipe be a grand replacement for her\\'s.  Truly a GREAT one! Made this Lasagna last night, everyone go back for seconds.  Was the best I ever made. We will definitely make again! I though this be an excellent Lasagna.  I only have half a much cheese a needed, and use crush tomato since it be on hand.  The only reason I dock a star be because I think it need more season and I do quite a few modifications.  I do let the sauce simmer the full hour, but add additional spice and a good healthy glug of red wine.  \\r\\n\\r\\nThe rest of the family, include the kid really enjoy it.  Will be use this one again, but up the spices!  \\r\\n\\r\\nThanks NurseDi! Very good! Not overly saucy, so it hold together well and slice beautifully. Great flavour! My fiance have never have - and didn\\'t think he\\'d like - a lasagna with cottage cheese, but he really like this one!\\n\\nDidn\\'t have Italian Sausage so use 2 lb grind beef. Used  fresh herb in place of dried, and add rosemary to the mix. Didn\\'t have 2 can of tomato so use about a half dozen tomato from my garden (diced) with 1 can of stew tomatoes. For the cottage cheese part I add one thaw and drain brick of freeze chop spinach a another reviewer suggest to sneak in more veggies, a well a a generous grate of nutmeg (my no-so-secret ingredient for Italian cooking). I also opt to use the ready-to-bake noodle rather than the kind that need boiling, just because they\\'re easy to handle and cut down on clean up time.\\n\\nI didn\\'t want to make a full 9x13\" pan of lasagna for just the two of us, so I do up two 8\" x 8\" foil square pan (each of which will fee u for 2 days). This result in lot of leftover filling, so use what I have on hand I also get two 6\" round and one 4\" round pie tin - perfect for single servings! Baked one of the 8\" pan to eat right away, and the others go into the freezer for easy supper late on. \\n\\nThanks for a great recipe! Wow! Delicious...I use half grind chuck and half lean grind beef because that be what I have but I be excite to try it again with the sausage. Also, we enjoy the taste of this with the cottage cheese but I can\\'t say that it make the dish one way or the other so I would say the ricotta and cottage cheese be pretty interchangeable here. Also, I use no boil noodle and the one on top didn\\'t really cook because I didn\\'t put more sauce on top so if you do opt for no boil then put more sauce on the last layer and then the extra mozzarella. Thank you! AWESOME. I only use 1lb beef and it turn out sooo good! Will be make again - follow instruction and it turn out perfectly. Perhaps I have my expectation too high, but I think this be okay-not a mind-blowing a the other reviews. I follow the recipe to a tee and although good, I certainly have have much better. Giving a recipe 5 star mean perfection...and I be afraid to say I didn\\'t go for seconds. I make 3 lasagna for a special supper for 25 person and they all love it. Very easy to make,  I do not put the sausage, instead I use 2 lb grind meat. I also use pre-cooked lasagna. I will definitely make it again. I already give the recipe to a couple of person.  Thank you. This be now our prefer lasagna recipe, minus the mozzarella & italian sausage. Thanks for posting! It be THAT good. I make it the night before and reheat it for a friend\\'s birthday lunch. He said, \"2lbs of meat and about 3lbs of cheese! How can you go wrong?\" I do use italian season insteaid of the dry herb and then add more basil to taste. This will be enter the \"Favorites\" folder. amazing!!!!!!! This be by far the best lasagna recipe I have found. It taste delicious and the consistency be perfect! Very good.  Used only 1 pound of grind beef and cut all the other ingrediants in half except the onion and garlic and bake in 9X9 pan. We love this one!  We use slice mozzarella, make it VERY cheesy! Delicious! Followed the recipe perfectly except only use 1 can of whole tomato just a family preference and it be delicious, so cheesy! Thanks for the post! This be a definite hit in my house and my husband say it be worth at least ten stars. It be not difficult to make with impressive results. Thanks for the recipe. I have make this several time and my family LOVES it!  I sometimes double or triple the sauce ingredient and freeze some for later.  Thanks for post Just call u your 236th happy customer.  My family really enjoy this.  I more or le double the recipe and make a few small one for the freezer.  Definitely recommend double the sauce at least because you could use the sauce for many things.  My kid really enjoy this - thanks! I accidentally use TURKEY Italian sausage. It still taste great! \\nThough, I have make this once with pork.. it be good with pork Italian sausage, obviously... I\\'m not a lasagna fan but my spouse ask me to make a lasagna and I choose this recipe.  One word.... WOW!  I\\'m 46 year old and You have just turn me into a lasagna fan... a definite yes for make this again!\\r\\n\\r\\nI use grill eggplant in lieu of the mid-layer noodle and it be a big hit!  I know what I will be make for my next pot luck!\\r\\n\\r\\nThanks for sharing! I can\\'t believe that I forget to rate this! I make it for a wake ( actually I double it , so that I would have some for my family)  My dear hubby get into the burger so I use a pound of bratwurst. I have never use cottage cheese, I use fat free and there be no complaints. Everyone say that it be delicious. So I will definitely make this again! This Lasagna be the absolute best ever.  I use oven ready noodle so I add 14 1/2 oz. of water to the sauce mixture for more moisture.  I also add 1 Tblsp of sugar to the sauce.  I use 32 oz of ricotta with 3 egg & adjust the season for the cheese mixture accordingly.  (We love cheese).  I put a layer of sauce on the bottom of the pan first, (10X15X2 Coringware Roaster), then place a layer of the oven ready noodle and so on, finish with the sauce on the last layer of noodle and top with some more parmesan cheese remain mozzerella.  Covered with foil and bake for 40 mins, remove foil and bake 10 more minutes.  Gave 15 min to rest and served.  I have never use the oven ready noodle before and will now never boil lasagna noodle again.  Awesome!  Made 2x in 2 week for family/friend gatherings.  This recipe be easy and delicious.  I will definitely use this recipe again. I make this for my friend for her birthday dinner because she request something homey. Absolutely perfect! Sooo yummy! My friend love it and she\\'s not easy to please:) We finish off half of it between three people!! I add a bite more garlic cause thats the way I like it and didn\\'t have time to simmer for the full hour but half an hour do the job. Absolutely gorgeous! Thanks!! Next time I will add some wine to the sauce. It be good but not the \"Absolute Best\" we have ever had! You be right!! This be Absolute. I use your recipe and follow it just like you have it. Very Very good..I will not change nothing. Thank You for sharing. Hugs This really be the absolute best lasagna I have ever made! It be quite simple and very delicious. I add mushroom to the meat/tomato mixture. I like the idea of add spinach. I\\'ll have to try that next time. I do find the whole tomato a mess to chop so I think I will use dice from now on. It do make alot! My 9x13 glass pan be fill to the brim! Thanks for sharing, I can\\'t wait to make this again! I have make this lasagna a few times, and very time it turn out amazing! The only change I make be I use all lean grind beef in place of italian sausage.  My husband and daughter love it! I have make this ALOT! It be my family fave! The italian sausage make it taste amaze and add\\'s so much flavor!  Thankyou for the amaze recipe. Excellent!  I use VENISON and my husband say it be the best I have make and my daughter love it!  I didn\\'t have any italian sausage but I will use it next time just to taste it.  Otherwise, I follow it all (except I run out of Parsley so only use about 1/4 of what be call for.  The venison be a perfect match for the recipe, couldn\\'t taste the game at all and we don\\'t mix our meat when processing!  This will be the recipe I use from now on! It be delicious!  We use half ricotta and half cottage cheese but otherwise follow the recipe.  It\\'s the best I\\'ve ever had, thank you for share the recipe!  YUMMY! Amazing!  This recipe make me look like a pro :)  Added some red chili flake to the sauce to spice thing up.  I\\'ll definitely be make this again. Very good. The recipe fill two casseroles! So, I freeze one, and eat one. I\\'m hop it freeze well... I\\'ll be sure to update once it\\'s baked! i be go to give it a 4 star beause no one ask for me to cook it again even though we all eat two serve of it. I make the recipe a write except that I use ricotta and I didn\\'t have the tomato for the sauce, so I use a jar of Prego (1lb 8oz) instead.  I think that the sauce look good a far a amount and consistency.  Ok, I\\'ll admit that I have difficulty with choose the right size pan.  I have a metal 9x13, but that seem too small, I be afraid my glass 11x13 have side that be too small - plus it be too much overlap with the noodles.  I choose a large glass pyrex that I have - it\\'s about 10x14.  I think that leave off with the noodle be strange, but I figure the sauce would come up and around during baking.  It didn\\'t, and the top be all hard and dry out.  Although the fillings/layers cover the area, they be thin, and the result be a very dry, crumbly lasagne.  I couldn\\'t taste the sausage.  it be very disappointing.  I have about 2/3 of the pan leave after dinner (for 5).  If I make it again (and that\\'s a big if), I\\'d probably opt for the small 9x13 pan and put sauce on the top before the cheese. Delicious lasagna. I add tomato sauce because I like mine saucier. Overall a great meal! I don\\'t know about \"Absoute Best Ever\" but certainly \"Best I Ever Made\" lasagna!  We easily double this recipe to send one to a friend and one for us.   I have to admit, it be even tasty the next day a leftovers! This recipe taste great!  I use my crock pot to cook the lasagna in and I use no boil noodles.  I couldn\\'t be easier.  I do forget the sausage at the store, but it be still delish.  Can\\'t wait to try it again! I\\'ll add my rave review to all the others. Instead of make a lasagna like I always do, I decide to peek at some recipe to see what others do. I usually don\\'t add sausage but decide to go all out. The direction don\\'t say to drain the fat from the brown meat, but I do (and there be plenty of it). I also add about a half teaspoon of fennel seed because I saw a few other recipe that include them. I use ricotta rather than cottage cheese too. Like another reviewer, I add 1 tomato paste can of water to thin the sauce a little. I end up use 3 layer of 4 noodles, for a total of 12. It all come out fantastic. My 5 year old eat a huge portion and ask for seconds! This be SOOO good!!! Will make again. I use half grind chuck and half sausage, also do half and half with the cottage cheese and ricotta. Thanks for sharing! This be a really delicious lasagna. I go and buy a deep dish aluminum pan so I be able to put 4 layer of noodles, use 15 noodles.  Normally I only do 3 layer because I run out of room, but 4 be so much good tasting. I do mix half cottage cheese and half ricotta. Everything work out in the proper proportions. The flavor be so yummy...I weigh the lasagna and couldn\\'t believe it weigh 16 lbs. Quite a lot of reviewer say it be salty but I didn\\'t find it be at all and I have add the salt when I be brown the meats. Maybe it be the brand of cheese be use that could make it salty. All I know be mine be absolutely delicious !! Also it be perfectly easy to cut and serve after it rest for 20 minutes. Thanks for share your wonderful recipe ratherbeswimmin.. Forgot to say I will post the pic I take when I can download to this computer. Excellant!!!! I have make this recipe a few time now... It just dosn\\'t get any good than this...Very easy to make and the taste be absolutely awsome!!! Only change be to reduce the salt to 1/2 t. salt....Thank you for post this wonderful recipe I make this again use Recipe #347336 for the sauce(I have it in the freezer).  I put some of the sauce over the noodle and then top with the cheese.  Excellent lasagna.  I have to make due with what I have on hand because of the nearly four foot of snow we have.  Only have 15 oz. of ricotta, and six oz. tomato paste.  I may save some sauce to put on top of the last layer of noodle then top with cheese a mine be very tough. Ok so this be the 2nd time that I have make this Lasagna and it be my family\\'s absolute favorite! \\r\\nI do use smoke sausage instead of Italian sausage. I decide to go with ricotta cheese. I kick it up a bite with add Pepperoni to the top layer then the cheese! Oh man it be so good this way and the pepperoni be my boy favorite part! Thanks for share this awesome and good recipe!! I think it be really good.  Next time I would double the cottage cheese/ricotta mixture.  And 1/2 lb le meat.  I think it be too much meat and not enough cheese. But it taste very good still. I make this lasagna last week and it turn out great my whole family love it.I use ricotta cheese a I do not have any cottage cheese on hand.I will definetely be make this again.Thanks for the recipe Wow. This be absolutely amazing. I do two thing differently. I add a bite of sugar to the simmer sauce and I substitute Italian Sausage for Smoked Beef Sausage (which I prefer). It be delicious. I serve it to 6 of my guest and they all believe it to be the best they have ever had! I will be use this a my main lasagna recipe, every time. We just finish dinner le than 30 minute ago and I\\'m already post a review. I\\'ve make lasagna before but it never come out right. This be excellent! I add some chop portabella mushroom and red pepper flake to the meat mixture then add a package of freeze spinach to the cheese mixture. Great recipe, my family enjoy this!! This be wonderful and it do really stay stack up when serving. Like others, I use dice tomatoes, along with the paste. I try half cottage cheese, that I let dry on paper towel in the fridge for an hour or so, and I slather Ricotta on the no boil noodle like peanut butter on a cracker. Since I couldn\\'t decide between Ricotta and Cottage, I go with both! It be delicious, and enormous and get rave from all who sample the leftover a well. Made for friend and family to rave reviews.  What a delicious lasagna! Super yummy!! Made it with half ricotta and half cottage cheese.  I be nervous about use all cottage cheese but the consistency with half be good.  The lasagna even stand up well after cook and it look pretty! Yummy!  I used<br/>1 lb of Italian Sausage & <br/>1 lb of grind beef, <br/>Cottage Cheese, not ricotta & I used<br/>Barilla no boil lasagna noodle to save me time.  Worked great!<br/>A definite keeper! I have a very picky family.  They love this recipe & request it when they be bring home guests.  I double the recipe and put up half of the sauce in a ziplock to freeze.  This way every other time I make this there be le than 30 minute of prep before baking.  I prefer not to freeze my cheese so I make the noodle and cheese mixture the day I bake it.  I follow the recipe exactly and choose to use cottage cheese. Oh my god this lasagna taste like heaven. By far the best lasagna I ever had. The testure be a bite runny, it didn\\'t stand still. But it didn\\'t really matter because the taste make up for it. Deeelish! SUPER GOOD! I be crave a nice saucy, cheesy lasagna and this hit the spot. I make two changes: the store be out of whole can tomato (!- I know, right??) so I use crushed. I maybe would have like the sauce a little sweet but since I didn\\'t follow the recipe to a \"T\" I\\'ll attribute it to that and I use turkey Italian sausage which be just a good in something like this, I think, and since it\\'s le expensive and low in fat and  blah blah blah. Sum up: great lasagna. Make it. You will not regret it. OH, and it make a TON. It do 2 heap pans, an 8x8 and an 8x10 so I freeze one for a rainy day. I use some leftover from-scratch spaghetti sauce, very similar to the sauce in this recipe. Everything else I follow to a T. It turn out perfect! Husband love it, and even my picky three-year-old like it. Scrum-didily-umptious!! Thank you for share This the same recipe I have use for years. I don\\'t measure so it never taste the same. Somethings that I do to it are: rotel tomato for a little kick, crimini mushrooms, and spinache. I also double the ricota cheese filling. Everytime I make it for a gather no one worry about thier diet.<br/>Tip: I think that the no boil noodle really take away from the dish. I use regular noodle and do not boil them, just layer them in uncooked.......fine dining. Usually lasagna be just... ok to me. Not this - THIS WAS AMAZING.<br/>My modifications: Added bacon, use pork sausage, add a little rosemary, marjaram and red pepper flakes, 1/2 tb sugar. <br/>For cheese I use cottage cheese (drained on paper towel), mozzerella, parmesan and romano. The no boil noodle be legit.<br/>Thanks for post a great recipe. I make this for Christmas Eve dinner and it be a hit!  I use cottage cheese in place of the ricotta and I didn\\'t cook the pasta since I make it early in the day and it be saucy enough that the noodle come out perfect. Several people ask for the recipe and I will gladly pas it along.  Thanks for sharing, ratherbeswimmin\\'! I make this for Christmas Day and everyone love it! I\\'ve make it once before so I have a few modifications. I use only 1 lb. of grind beef....it be a little too meaty last time I make it. I use can of dice tomato and add a small can of tomato sauce. Also use 3 clove of garlic. I opt for ricotta cheese and use the large package (not sure oz). I do cook my lasagna noodle first and do not have any problem but will try not cook them next time...save me a step. This be my go-to meat lasagna recipe! YUM I\\'ve be make the same lasagna for over 50 year - the recipe from Better Homes & Garden.  I\\'ve always really like it.  Rather than dig out my recipe, I look on Food.com to see if i could find a similar one.  This be really close, but use more meat and more spices.  This be awesome - I won\\'t be go back to my old recipe - this be the one I will use from now on.  Thanks so much for posting. Excellent!  Really enjoy the meaty gravy and compile a \"best of\" from the other comment on this board.  I use half cottage and half ricotta cheese and find it to be a great combination.  I use uncooked pasta (not oven ready) and it turn out perfectly.  I add 1 can of tomato paste full of water to the gravy and bake it for 35 minute cover with tin foil and 25 minute uncovered.  Let stand for 20 minute and it be not messy at all.  The pasta soak up all the extra liquids.  Wow. Love this but we use half cottage cheese / half ricotta and use the oven ready lasagna noodles.  So easy!  Add about 1/4 cup of red wine to the sauce too! I have never make lasagna but love it so much.  I have just always think it be to much work.  Well this be a great recipe.  It be so delicious.  I make it with cottage cheese. I cut the recipe in 1/2 since it be just my husband, my son and myself.  My son (pickiest 7 yr old ever) eat 3 servings! The leave over be even more amazing.  Defiantly a keeper and easy too. I will make this now all the time instead of freeze lasagna! I have to make a lot of change because of what I have (or didn\\'t have) lie around the house... I omit the sausage and can of whole tomatoes.  Instead of tomato paste, I use a jar of ragu and a cup of water. I only have a small container of ricotta (16 oz) so I double up on the parmesan and add cook broccoli.  DH\\'s mom be from Italy, so I have a lot to live up to and he LOVED this lasagna!! The only problem be the top noodle need sauce on top because they get kind of hard. <br/><br/>excellent recipe, thank for sharing! :) Great classic lasagna casserole.  I double the sauce portion of the recipe because I like my lasagna on the saucy side.  Didn\\'t quite use all the extra sauce, but really like it this way.  I use the ricotta option.  Great for a buffet or potluck. Fantastic!  This go over really well at the potluck I recently take it to.  The only alteration I make be to add in a few red chili flakes, a tablespoon of brown sugar, and 1/2 teaspoon of fennel seeds.  Otherwise, make a direct use ricotta.  Thanks for a wonderful lasagna! The name of this recipe say it all!  The preparation be a bite time consuming, but well worth it!  I will be make this again.  Thank you so much for post this excellent recipe!! Absolutely great. Would not change anything. Even great reheated. 2 lb bison meat, ricotta cheese and Italian seasoning. Delicious! Excellent lasagna.  Doubled the recipe and freeze one to enjoy later.  Thanks! I have make this lasagna multiple times. It always turn out great!!! My husband love it and he be Italian! Not dry, not runny, perfect! My first time make lasagna and I be very happy with the results! It actually taste good reheated. The top noodle get crisp and leathery so next time I make this I be baste the top layer in sauce and cover with foil for half the bake time, then add the cheese and bake the remain time uncovered. I use fat-free cottage cheese, 6 garlic cloves, add about a tablespoon of nutmeg and make my own Italian pork sausage before hand. I will be make this again many time I be sure. I think I will increase the cheese sauce some and will try add a few dollop of sour cream and some Munster cheese to the cheese sauce mixture for more creamy richness and flavor. I will also need to improve on my Italian sausage recipe. Didn\\'t use sausage and wouldve be even good have i. Delicious! use dice tomato and sauce and add extra water. SO GOOD! This be my first time make Lasagna in the oven and not the crock pot. I dont think I will ever do it any other way again. After read other reviews, here be what I did.<br/>I double the sauce (were saucy people) and we dip our garlic toast in the leave over sauce. I use only grind beef, because it be what I have on hand. I use Italian season instead of the other seasonings. 2 TBSP of brown sugar in the sauce. I put my cheese mixture right into my meat sauce. I find it easy to layer that way. It be to die for! I feel like I be go to roll everywhere because I eat so much! Thank you for posting! Very Good Dish. Hubby and I love it. Yum... I haven\\'t even eat the lasagna yet, but I know it\\'s go to be awesome because of the sauce! I use a large 28 oz can of crush tomatoes, other than that I follow your ingredient for the sauce exactly. I let it simmer for over an hour add chicken broth every so often and let it cook down (like a ragu) and then in the end I add a cup of milk and let it cook down again. It be so delicious! I use 1/2 fat free ricotta and 1/2 cottage cheese. Can\\'t wait until it\\'s done! Thanks!! Best EVER. Seriously. I\\'ve try a few lasagna recipe in my day, and this be by far the best and SO worth the time spent. My sweet husband be very impressed. Thank you!!! Great recipe! I have a real problem follow recipe to a T, consequently my lasagna be sometimes good, sometimes not so good. This little gem be a god send for my family, NOW when we have lasagna it\\'s ALWAYS good. Thanks for share this with us. Awesome Lasagna recipe!  I take this recipe and make it for a OAMC session.  I then make it into two small casserole dish for two lasagna and they be overflow with the food.  I then freeze both, thaw one all day and bake it accord to directions.  Tasted fabulous and I be able get 8 large slice out of one casserole so with both I have 16 serve v the 10 the recipe estimate for servings.  I will definately be make this again. My husband say this be the best lasagna he ever ate! Thanks for the great recipe. Very good! I use some cook bacon instead of sausage a that\\'s what I happen to have on hand, and 8 garlic cloves! I usually make lasagna with Bechamel sauce rather than a ricotta mixture, so this be a nice change of pace for me. The lasagna noodle I use be pre-cooked, and the next time I will moisten the top layer with something before sprinkle on the cheese - the top layer turn out a bite dry because the noodle be dry go into the oven! Thank you for a lovely recipe! The absolute BEST ever! The recipe be perfect and it leave my family beg for more. Fabulous, authentic... there be shameful restaurant claim to be Italian that serve overprice lasagna that do not come even close to this marvelous recipe make EXACTLY AS IS! PLEASE, make it once a it be written, savor the FRESHLY make taste, then savor a the flavor blend and deepen over the follow days... can it possibly just keep get better? Seems so. After make this AS IS ONCE, feel free to tweak the ingredient to suit family preference should you find it necessary: we might add 1/4 cup of red wine & just a bite more Italian herb seasoning. BUT, this might be the BEST LASAGNA I\\'ve have since college day (forty year ago) when invite to the home of a frat brother (Italian) to shoot pool and eat Mama\\'s home cooking! This lasagna definetely uphold it name. I be never a big fan of lasagna, but with this recipe, I\\'m sold. Very easy and delicious. I use the can dice tomato with oregano, basil & garlic even though the recipe have all three because I already have that in hand. I didn\\'t use le herb but it be not overpowering. Loved it, love it, thank for sharing! My friend and I all think this be great!  I add spinach,did half ricotta and half cottage cheese and leave a section without meat for my vegetarian friend.  It be a hit! My favorite recipe.  thanks!!!!  absolutely perfect! I serve this for my family and friend last night. It be really good and the husband go back for plentiful seconds! I love the flavor and texture of it, very creamy and moist. I even use the no boil noodles. I prefer my lasagna more \"saucy\" so I didn\\'t give it 5 stars, but still very good! Followed the recipe. Didn\\'t have a \\'lasagna pan\\'. Came out dry and somehow the meat sauce lose favor during the bake process. I\\'m hop it will be good a leftovers. Excellent lasagna!!! I use Italian style dice tomato and the cottage cheese option. The sauce be a little thick so I add more water. I also add spinach to the cheese mixture. All my guest rave about how good this was. Thanks so much for share this true keeper. I be look for a lasagna recipe that I have make before.  I forget to save it and couldn\\'t find it in all the lasagna recipe on here. After spend way too much time searching, I decide to make this one instead because of it\\'s rave reviews.  While everyone think it be good, no one go back for seconds.  It work in a bind though.  Thanks. Perfect!! I use leftover sauce (recipe #26217) and I leave out the parmesan inside the lasagna. Instead I just sprinkle parmesan on top of it after it be done. I use ricotta instead of the cottage cheese and I use no-boil lasagna noodles. Since I use the no-boil noodles, I cook the lasagna for 50 mins. I cover it with aluminum foil for the first 40 min so that the mozzarella on top wouldn\\'t get burnt. This be good than any lasagna that I\\'ve ever get at a restaurant! Should come with warning...only make if you\\'re experience at make lasagna.  Directions be confuse and I forget the tomato paste because of hire they be written.  Also I didn\\'t know to put sauce on top or cover with foil before baking...so my to noodle come out crunchy.  Will try again though now that I know. Thank you ratherbeswimming. This be the best lasagna recipe ever!! I have nothing but praise about it. This will be my go to lasagna from now on. I make it on a Monday and have it on Wednesday just to let the flavor marry. It be so flavorful so yummy!!! My hubby say it be to die for and my<br/>brother in law say 20 gold stars. Thanks again for sharing. I make the follow change to this recipe:  grind turkey/turkey sausage for the meat, 2 can dice tomato for the whole, add one tomato paste can of water to the sauce, uncooked whole wheat noodles.  My husband like the flavors, but say it be a little \\'drier\\' than I normally make...that be probably from my tweaking, and I fix this the second time I make it.  I have make this again, and add one more can of dice tomato (3 total) to the sauce mixture, and 2 small can of water.  PERFECT!   I use regular whole wheat noodle (not the \\'no bake\\' kind), and I don\\'t cook them before I assemble the lasagna.  I like the texture and taste of the noodle more when they be cook in the lasagna instead of beforehand.  The flavor in the recipe be really good and this be an outstanding lasagna!!  I use this recipe a my guide, and just tweak it to make it saucy for our taste!! Defintely the absolute best ever lasagna. SO yummy, love the combo or the sausage and hamburger.  Very good leftovers, my boyfriend approved! Delicious!! The best!! I go a little light on the meat just for convenience reasons, but still use both kinds. I also use cottage cheese which I pulse in a food processor until creamy (and add an extra egg to bind the liquid). I have a bunch in the freezer that husband and I will be have for dinner several more times. Just wrap portion into foil, put into freezer bag, then microwave for several minutes. I\\'ll be make this again. We have make this a few time now and it truly be the best lasagna I\\'ve ever eat - AWESOME! This recipe be amazing! The only bad note be that the meat sauce should also top the final layer of the noodles, or else it dry out very quickly. I also have to add extra sauce (about another can of tomato sauce, 8 oz) because it wasn\\'t very moist. Letting it stand for 15 minute be just right. The flavor be perfect, exactly the way lasagna should be! This be really good but the there should not be a layer of noodle on top. It should have have sauce then cheese. The noodle get super hard and the cheese become one with the noodle so you lose the ooey gooey effect. Great flavor, but miss the mark with the execution. This recipe be amazing!  I make it for the first time for my boyfriend and his father when we first start dating.  His mother and sister go to Mexico.  Needless to say, I win over his father quick!  Anyway, I now make it pretty regularly.  The kid love it a well.  I make it a written, except I double the season and add a tablespoon of Johnny\\'s salt.  LOVE! I have make this several time and it be perfect every time. It be good than most restaurant lasagna and get a 5 star rat from everyone that eat it. Very Awesome Lasagna, absolutely awesome! 5 stars! i cant find anything wrong with this recipe sooo good thx! Loved this!  I make my own sauce and be skeptical about follow the sauce recipe but it be a hit.  This be my first lasagna and will be my go to recipe - turn out perfectly!  The sauce be also so easy to make and delicious I will use it a a quick weekday recipe too. I make this for the first time this past weekend.  Let me start off by say I have very limit cook skills.  However I decide to give this a try and let tell you, it turn out amazing!  I use ricotta rather than cottage cheese.  This recipe will rival any lasagna.  Just incredibly good hearty lasagna. This be best ever! Made exactly a recipe except use hunt 28 oz can puree tomato plus the two can tomato paste because we like smooth sauce, no tomato chunks. Everybody love it! Have find my go to lasagna recipe! Sorry! I leave a write review and forget to rate the recipe! 5 star all the way!! This be a hit tonight.  I serve it with crusty french bread (#101476) with olive oil and herb and it be delicious.  Great meal.  I end up use 1 lb grind beef and 1 lb italian sausage.  Other than that everything remain the same.  I have enough cheese mixture and meat sauce leave to cover the top layer of noodle with more of both and then top with mozzarella.  Lasagna be a great meal that just take so much time, but it be worth it in the end. This be a terrific recipe.  I use ricotta instead of cottage cheese and a 29 ounce can of dice tomato instead of a can of whole tomato that have to be diced.  \\'Will definitely make this dish over and over again! It be absolutely delicious! I\\'m not a pasta fan and my family be very picky and we love it! I even forget the parmesean cheese and it be still great!! Thanks for share :) Love it - it\\'s the only recipe I\\'ll use for Lasagna.  I don\\'t normally eat leftover but this I look forward too.  Thank you for sharing. Made this today for dinner today and  I have a husband who be a perfectionist who LOVED it. I omit ricotta cheese and sausage. I add mushrooms, red and yellow bell peppers. It come out delicious. Thanks for the recipe. Excellent recipe and pretty easy. I cook allot but have never make lasagna before. This recipe be easy and delicious. Husband love it and request it often. Excellent Lasagna.  Used grind corn & clover feed venison instead of grind beef and it turn out phenomenally.  Thanks for share the recipe. This be really really the best lasagna I have ever eaten. I make it for a family celebration. 18 people consume 2 very large pan and want more. This be NOW \"MY secret recipe\" <3 sssshhhh~!! A wonderful recipe.  I love that there be enough sauce and enough cheese fill so that there be no skimp a you build the layers. I use turkey sausage and extra lean grind beef, and all the cheese be low fat. I also use whole wheat noodles.  It would be great no matter what you used.  This will be my go-to lasagna recipe. I have make this several time and it have always be a bite hit, but last night a friend of ours who have the hard time ask for anything in her life call me and said, do you know what i want for my birthday this year (normally the most depress day in her life accord to he). - no -- a tray of your lasagna -- that she could ask for it be amaze and it remind me to say thank you -- sometimes food not only taste good, but it heals. Lasagna be my favorite dish and this be the best I\\'ve ever make - no contest! I use 1 lb of grind beef and 1 lb Italian sausage. I use cottage cheese. I add maybe a teaspoon of rosemary. It do stack up high and overflow the pan a little in the oven, but I didn\\'t even mind the mess. I bake it a little long uncover so the cheese would get good and melty on top. It be perfect! Absolute best ever lasagna?  YEP!!! Holy cow, so good!  I use 1/2 cottage cheese and 1/2 ricotta,   spinach. I add a little water to the sauce because I use oven ready noodles. This be now my go-to lasagna recipe. I make this yesterday a a special meal for my husband since he come from abroad and want to pamper him with his favourite dish :) It be more delicious than I expect and it really deserve more than 5 stars. I make some adjustment a per below but it turn out just a wonderful:<br/>   1. instead of Italian sausage, I use Milan salami a I couldn\\'t find<br/>   2. I use 1/4 lb. mozzarella for the ricotta fill a I didn\\'t have enough<br/>   3. I prepare some white sauce use milk, margarine, salt and flour and top the lasagne with it. I become super creamy and I only use about 2 table spoon of mozzarella on top of the sauce.<br/><br/>Simply delicious and I WOWWed my husband with it :) Made this for dinner two night ago and my husband and one year old son love it. We be still eat the leftover TWO day later. The recipe be ok but no Italian I know use Cottage Cheese. This be almost identical to our famly lasagna except you add oregano.  My lasagna be amaze so with oregano it would be just a great.  We\\'re have lasagna for Christmas dinner. Yep! It\\'s the best lasagna ever! I think we have a new tradition for Christmas dinner. I assemble it yesterday. I use 1lb. of grind turkey and 1lb. of spicy pork sausage, cottage cheese and add a little more season to that mixture, crush tomato instead of whole. I only have one can of tomato paste, and use no boil noodles. I add about a up and a half of water to the sauce a per the direction on noodle package . I like sauce on the top, so I just save some to use on top. I bake it cover for 1/2 hour and uncover for 15 mins. It come out PERFECT! Thanks for share this fantastic recipe. I have decide a long time ago that I need to try my hand at make my own lasagna. This weekend, I finally do it... and use this recipe. I be cook for a crowd, and everyone love it. My boyfriend - whose best friend&#039;s family be from Italy - even say it be the best lasagna he&#039;s ever had. I do tweak it a bite - I roast a red pepper, puree it, and add it with the tomato and meat while simmering. I also add some chili pepper paste, some black pepper, and some garlic salt to the mixture. Thank you for post this recipe - I will be make it again for sure. Very good! This recipe may be the start of a new Christmas tradition for my friend and family.  I be excite to try this recipe base  upon all of the review posted.  I follow the recipe to the letter - use Ricotta -  and only stray just before I place the pan into the oven by add a thin layer of Provolone and Parmesan cheese on top.  I serve the lasagna along with the Chopped Italian Salad (amazing) by NcMystery Shopper and the Italian Bread Casserole (wonderful) by Brooke the Cook in WI. There be not one morsel of food remain on any of my 18 guest\\'s plates.  Everyone comment on how delicious the entire meal taste and some even muse a to how shock they be I could actually cook.  All three recipe be easy to follow and recommend all three dish be serve a an entire meal.  <br/><br/>I think this be a very good recipe and will make it again for large, casual gatherings. my mom make this and it be awesome.  only downside be it be quite expensive to make. I make this with half meat and half vegetable lasagna. I simply reduce the meat to 1 pound and split everything else into two skillet and instead of use meat, I dice up green and red pepper with some zucchini and simmered. I also use can pasta sauce instead of tomatoes. The meal turn out great. Could also combine all into one skillet a well...I just need a vegetarian friendly meal and this be perfect! Ok, I be try this for the first time.....still in the oven.  I didn\\'t put noodle on the top because I always have the issue of them dry out.  So I do meat, cheese mixture, then top with mozzarella.  We shall see!  I know I like more sauce so I double the cheese mixture and almost double the meat mixture.  Seemed perfect for my pan.  I swear that they need to make 9x13 pan tall though because mine be always heaping!  I have to add more salt because my tomato didn\\'t have any in them and it definitely need more salt.  So I would suggest, taste your meat mixture a it simmer to see if you like more or le salt or more of the seasonings.  It will be delicious I just know it!!  And it be really cheap to make IMO. WOW!!! I dont normally write a review for a recipe but this be so DELICIOUS that i must! 5 star for sure!!! I be so excite about this recipe and it will be the only lasagne I will ever make again! be AMAZING the family love it! like someone else comment i add a little sugar to the sauce. i also add some lawrys salt a well. 5 STARS!! lovedddddd it!! best lasagna ever!! This be very good, definitely worth prepare again. I make a mistake however, and I want to share it so others won\\'t fall into the same trap. I follow the recipe exactly, except that without think I use \"no boil\" lasagna noodles.  I\\'ve have great success with them in the past and didn\\'t stop to think about the fact that this recipe call for just noodle and cheese for the top layer. Well, the no-cook noodle need to be moist or they remain hard and almost brittle. FOR SURE, either boil your own noodle per the recipe or, if you be go to use the no-cook kind a I did, make sure you top the lasagna with sauce and cheese on the top! I be able to \"save\" my lasagna when I realize what be happen by add some quickly prepare sauce on top, but it be a nuisance and result in a le than spectacular look dish. This be the recipe my mom use for year and I have continue use for 46 more years.  It be the best ever!  My husband like it good than any he order at the best Italian restaurants.  It may not be authentic, but the taste be outstanding. I\\'m glad you share it. My family think this be GREAT. I don\\'t know if I would say the best ever but it be good. I think my only problem with it be because I be use to use ricotta cheese and try cottage cheese this time. Next time I make it I will give it a try with ricotta cheese. I will tell you that the beef mixture with the spice and tomato be REALLY REALLY good. The only alteration I make be use no bake noodle and add 16oz water.  I prepare the dish the night before and bake it the follow day.  It be excellent. I\\'ve make many lasagna recipe and prefer this one....bar none!!! After read all of these 5 star review I think this be go to be insanely good.  Unfortunately, it&#039;s just a run of the mill lasagna.  I didn&#039;t find anything special about this.  It wasn&#039;t  saucy enough (on the dry side than I like), not enough cheese (not gooey!), and the meat mixture be pretty standard.  I&#039;m move on to find a good recipe.  Unfortunate too, since make lasagna be time consume I be hop for better. This be a very good lasagna recipe. I have to add a bite of water to the sauce while it be simmering, so I will be careful to use the exact amount of meat next time around and have an extra can of tomato sauce ready in case it&#039;s too thick. The spice be perfect and I also cover the lasagna for 25 minute and then remove it until it be finished. Turned out perfect! Yummy!!!  This lasagna be very good!  I make some little change to have a low fat and healthy version!  Used turkey sausages, whole wheat lasagna pasta, extra-lean beef, low fat cottage cheese.  I also add some freeze spinach to the cheese mixture.  It be delicious! :) This be a really good recipe! I look at a few recipe before decide on this one. Glad I pick the right one. My husband use to hate lasagna. Now he can&#039;t live without it (smile). If you&#039;re new to make lasagna--like myself--these instruction be a bite vague (unless I miss counted, the &#039;add the next five ingredients&#039; should have be &#039;six&#039; to include the tomato paste).  I have to find a youtube video to make sure I be layer the dish correctly.  It could have use more ricotta.  The lasagna be good, but I find it a bite lack in flavor.  Next time, I will use to this recipe a base, but I will improvise. After 20 year of marriage and make lasagna, I finally get a &quot;hey, you should write this recipe down.&quot;  I follow recipe a is, but use grass feed beef and whole wheat lasagna noodle (uncooked). I add a tomato paste can and a half of water, and put sauce in the pan first, follow by the raw noodles, then the layer a specified. I take the advice of others and cook 35 min cover and 25 min uncover then let it sit for 15 min outside of the oven. My secret.....use San Marzano tomatoes. If you haven&#039;t try these, DO IT. Worth every penny. Oh, also add about a teaspoonful of brown sugar to the sauce. Delish!!! Everyone in my home love it :) Excellent recipe! This be my first traditional lasagna, and it turn out great. I follow other suggestion and add one tomato paste can of water and use half ricotta and half cottage cheese. Fantastic flavor!  I make accord to direction except use a slightly small container of ricotta than call for.  Next time I&#039;ll use a large container. great flavor.  I like to think we be get lot of vegetable in every meal so I add dice spinach, mushroom and zucchini and my kid didn&#039;t pick anything out.  That&#039;s a change. Made this last week for dinner. Everyone love it!! My husband say it be delicious. Preparation be very easy, follow recipe step by step. Thank You!!! Will be make again soon! This be delicious! I follow the very important suggestion below to cover the lasagna with foil for the first 20-25 minute baking. I also follow the suggestion to use some portobello mushroom in place of 1/2 lb beef, since I want to eat just a tad le meat. I also find that I could have make 3/4 the amount of meat sauce and cheese mixture, because I be able to make an extra mini-lasagna!! Anyway, this be a great success overall and I be relieved, since I have never make lasagna before. Yummy lasagna! I do use regular spaghetti sauce instead of make it, though. Next time, I&#039;ll put it in a big pan because I didn&#039;t have room for everything in my 9x13. Thanks! I find this and be make it now! it smell SOOOO GOOD :) I personally think that this be a fantastic recipe.  Thank you for sharing.  As far a GRITSgirlie&#039;s comment in April.  Yes, you misread the recipe. This be really delish dish! Whole family (even in-laws) have extra helpings. I use cottage cheese and a italian cheese blend on top and it turn out wonderful. Thank you for the recipe! Very good and very easy...doubled the recipe and it be all go in days.  &lt;br/&gt;Added a little brown sugar to the sauce, half and half with the cottage cheese and ricotta cheese  and it be perfect.  &lt;br/&gt;And the  leave over be even better. This be EXACTLY the same a the lasagna recipe I get from my best friend back in high school...in the late 60&#039;s.   It be INCREDIBLE &amp; believe me, I&#039;ve make lot of lasagna over the past 45 years!  This recipe take a bite more time, but what good Italian cook doesn&#039;t? Leftovers freeze well too...if there be any.  I&#039;ve even catch my dear SIL make a &quot;sandwich&quot; use cold lasagna, slice into thick slices.  Oh...be sure to use a deep straight-sided bake dish. The Bobby Flay line of stoneware sell at Kohl&#039;s have a very nice one with handle that be great for this lasagna. This recipe be so generous it will overflow a standard 9x13 glass pan. And be sure to let it &quot;rest&quot; about 10 minute before cut or it will ooze it&#039;s cheesy goodness all over the plate! Delicious, fill recipe-no dessert required:)  Make sure that when you brown the meats, you drain off most of the fat before add teh other ingredients(this be for newbies) Dis&#039; be da Judge !   Yes&#039;sa !   Dis&#039; be da judge !!!!&lt;br/&gt;Mmmmmmm .... Mmmmm !!!  Slaps ma&#039; Mammy and call me .... Da Judge !!! &lt;br/&gt;&#039;Dis be juss .... &quot;Laripin Goooood !!!! This be an excellent. Recipe. Almost exactly like the one I&#039;ve be make for 35 years. It come from the McCalls Cookbook! Confusing and incomplete recipe not suit for beginners.  The number of comment that suggest significant change attest to the inadequacy of this recipe.  For instance, it be essential to cover the lasagna with foil (I like Release brand so it doesn&#039;t stick to the cheese) to avoid have the top turn into an inedible, impenetrable crust.  I&#039;ve be make lasagne for at least 50 year and can do it blindfold stand on my head, so the sketchy direction here be not a problem. However, I hate to think about all the disappointment this cause for beginners.  The America&#039;s Test Kitchen lasagna recipe be clear, specific, and detail and give fantastic result every time.  This recipe is, at best, a guide from which to innovate, but some of the omission be inexcusable. I have not try this recipe yet.  Having read some of the review I need some clarity.  Does it mean undrained for the whole tomato to add the liquid?  Do I drain the brown grind beef mixture or leave the grease?  It sound good but I&#039;d like a complete recipe. After read several page of review after review that this be the best thing they&#039;ve ever taste, I be sold. Had to try i. And my verdict? Honestly disappointed. I make it to the recipe exact. We find it on the dry side. Too much meat for me. Taste be certainly good, but nowhere near best ever. Quite disappointe. I screw up, in my last review. Did not follow the instruction a written. Cut the vegetable to fine. (Leave in chunks) do not use a blender. I have 3 people for dinner tonight they give it ***** I be post this review to inform others &quot;what not to do&quot;.&lt;br/&gt;I prepare the sauce the night before so the flavor could blend.&lt;br/&gt;Knew right away the sauce be right on target. Loved the smell of it and the thickness.&lt;br/&gt;Mistake #1 I add like 1/3 cup red wine.  (habit)&lt;br/&gt;Preparing. Mistake #2 I use fresh mozzarella.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;End result, not terrible but a bite too much moisture..my fault.&lt;br/&gt;I will make again and stick to the recipe.&lt;br/&gt;Usual review be I add this, I do this, I do not use this...&lt;br/&gt;Great recipe, my result , my problem.&lt;br/&gt;PS My hubby shops, I cook. I know the fresh moz...was go to be an issue. Wasn&#039;t impressed. My dh and I think it be lack in flavor. i follow recipe exactly a written. Will stick with my old recpie. The &quot;headline&quot; be absolutely correct !  It IS the best lasagne ever !!!! Served it the first time a a comfort food for friend come off the airplane to stay for a visit.&lt;br/&gt;Are go to serve it for the 2nd time to friend for lunch.  Since the weather have go down in temperature it feel like a good choice.  Hope for 2nd success ...... I have never make lasagna before, just a beginner in general! I read through quite a bite of the review before making, so I put a layer of sauce on the bottom, cover with foil and put extra liquid in the sauce while it be simmering. Unfortunately I also follow the advice that cook the noodle before hand be not totally necessary...... bad choice!!! haha the top layer of noodle be definitely tough and hard to cut into! Next time I will cook them just a bite AND put a layer of sauce on the very top instead of very bottom, it be a little messy than it need to be with sauce a the bottom layer.   &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Otherwise this lasagna be DELICIOUS and I will definitely be make again! &amp; the sauce smell AMAZING while it be simmer it be torture! Well worth the time and effort in my opinion. Thank you! Bought tomato sauce from my local Italian bakery, it be amazing. Cheesy, saucy, good enough for thirds!! I do use the cottage cheese since I have it, and I do sometimes prefer it that way. Wow, amazing!  I haven&#039;t make lasagna in a long time and decide to make ti recipe.  It be fantastic.  I use 1 lb of grind beef instead of 1 1/2 lbs, add some spinach, didn&#039;t buy enough ricotta cheese so I add some plain yogurt.  I also use RP&#039;s Gluten Free Refrigerated Lasagna sheets, no boiling, yay.  I probably would thin out the sauce a bite next time because I love some extra sauce.  I do a others say and let it cool 15 min before I cut it.  It be so good that it remind me of lasagna that I have at an expensive restaurant.  Great recipe! I take out the sausage and add more grind beef, also add freeze spinach into the egg mixture.  This dish be absolutely amaze and will definitely make again!!! Loved it... next time I will add more tomato sauce since my noodle really soak it up over night. Super Yummy!!   I add a little more cheese though.   Everyone love it!!! This lasagna be AMAZING! Honestly the best I&#039;ve ever eaten. My entire family love it, even my picky 2 year old. The only differencse I make be that I use 1 pound of each grind beef and sausage and add 2 Tbs of sugar to the sauce, a we like a sweet sauce. OUTSTANDING! Made this for Christmas, everybody love it. It&#039;s a keeper Amazing, make for the holiday this year and everyone enjoyed. OMG, I can&#039;t believe I make something so good from scratch. I don&#039;t think my family will ever go back to frozen! I follow the recipe mostly, use Ricotta cheese. My only change be to use grind venison rather than beef. Made my own lasagna noodle from the low carb pasta recipe on this site and it be great. I think this be close to 12 serve tho, a my family of 4 barely eat more than a quarter of this. With my low carb noodle I count this out around 10 carbs each with 12 servings. Delicious! Thanks for sharing. I make this pretty much exactly like it be written. It be good for dinner last night but somehow the flavor meld overnight make the leftover absolutely delicious today. One word de-li-cio-so! I make this last night. It be the first time I have ever make lasagna and it turn out great. It say 2:40 for prep and cooking, a a beginner it take me about 4 hrs. total time. I compare this to Olive Garden, it be that good!! You wont be dissatisfied! This be awesome! I cheat a little and use the low-fat Ragu alfredo sauce in place of make a bechamel and it turn out perfect. This be my new go-to! So good! We make it for our friend that just have a kid and they say it be the best meal that they have drop off for them. We add crush red pepper, and would probably do mushroom next time. the bad discusting recipe the bad and a waste of time to make it not the best it not even deasent This be the best lasagna ever. My boyfriend think it be good too! We love this!! I add the cottage and ricotta instead of one. It be amazing. Tasteless.  Spent 2 hour get this ready and it be like eat cardboard.  Won&#039;t cook it again. This lasagna be VERY full of taste!  I have have so many first here on zaar/food, and this be another one.  The sauce part of the recipe be the best taste homemade red sauce I have try or made.  Smelling the sauce a it cook be heavenly The recipe be a little fussy, but not difficult at all.  Left over be good the next day.  Froze the rest for later.  I have defrost and reheat freeze leftover and I think the taste suffer not one iota. Better than freeze Stouffers.  Just get around to reviewing, make this the middle of last month. Thanks for post this recipe ratherbeswimmin! This be a very good recipe.  I follow the ingredient exactly.  The only change I make be that I reserve some of the sauce to put on top of the last layer of noodles, then I top with the mozzarella cheese.  Delicious! Very good! I make my sauce yesterday (your recipe) and put the lasagna together tonight when I get home from work. I have leave over spinach dip so I put that in with the cheese mix kind of make it dump this in dump that in. Everyone have their own take on lasagna but this be really good. Thanks!! We really like this! Winner! thank swimmin, Nina This truly be the best lasagna we have ever had. It be definitely worth the work. I use fresh herb from my mom&#039;s garden and follow the recipe exactly. This be really good, my DH love lasagna and he say it was&#039;t the best he ever had, he prefer my original recipe that I use, but maybe it be due to me not have all of the ingredients.  I didn&#039;t have a much cottage cheese a it call for and it definitely could have be a little cheesier.  I would definitely make it again. I haven&#039;t try it but but I jump when I saw the nutritional fact :  61% SODIUM PER SERVING.  Sorry, it&#039;s way too much! We really do like this. I would definitely say it be probably the best homemade lasagna I&#039;ve had! Thanks for sharing. &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;I didn&#039;t have the whole tomato so I use the same size can of crush tomatoes.(plus I don&#039;t like chunky tomatoes)&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Update......I just absolutely LOVE this recipe. The best I have ever had! I decide to try this for my nephew and baby girl. My baby be funny about some cheese so I be skeptical but I love lasagna and all type of cheese. Needless to say it be a hit. My nephew absolutely love it and my baby pick off the noodle just for the filling. My cousin come and get two plat within 12 hour Nd he live across town. My nephew want me to make him a batch for his new place. I tweak it a bite with sour cream &amp; ricotta and it still come out great. Definitely a hit in my home. Will be make again very soon... This be great although I only give it 4 star since I change some thing a bite accord to other reviews. First I halve the recipe to use in an 8x8 dish. There&#039;s only two of u so it&#039;s plenty enough for dinner and leftovers. I use half a pound each of the meats, add an 8oz can of tomato sauce, 6oz of water and half tablespoon of brown sugar to the sauce before simmering. I add a good pinch of salt to the ricotta mixture but my own personal taste wish I have add a bite more. I layer some meat sauce on the bottom of the pan first and use standard lasagna noodle that I leave uncooked. (I have to break off the end of the noodle to make them fit but it turn out great...I be a little nervous it wouldnt) I continue to layer, make sure I have meat sauce to cover the top layer of noodle so they wouldn&#039;t dry out. I cover with foil, cook for 45 minute and then uncover to top with the mozzarella cheese. I continue to cook uncover for 25 minute and then I let it cool and set for 20. It turn out amaze and I&#039;d be happy to make it again. It&#039;s a keeper! Made this lasagna last week and it be great! I make this yesterday and it be AWESOME!! It be a bite labor intense, but well worth it! This yield 12 pieces, so we have dinner for a week. Delicious recipe, no change needed! It be the first time i make Lasagna, and it taste so gooood, absolute best ever, nice &amp; cheesy, thank you the whole family love it, just remember to cover with tin foil before cooking,  thank you again I LOVE this recipe! However, I use a whole lb Italian sausage and 1 lb lean grind beef, or grind turkey. I use ricotta cheese instead of cottage, I think it make the texture better. Other than that, I follow the recipe exactly, it&#039;s always a hit! Amazing!!  Sauce be what do it!  I halve the recipe too, and it still turn out.  I tweak it a bit, more for my tastes.  Adding some sugar and extra garlic.  I keep the large can of tomatoes, but purchase the chunk kind (I didn&#039;t feel like cut them myself).  And, of course extra cheese.  This recipe can be alter in many ways, that will not affect the flavors.  I will for sure use this again!! My first lasagna.  Made if for Valentine&#039;s Day and my boyfriend love it (and me!)  Only change be to add 1/4 t. fennel seed and a tiny pinch of cayenne.  Also tent it with foil while it cooked, and finish it under the broiler. I see mostly 5 star on this recipe.I make it today and didn&#039;t care for it. My wife recipe be much more simple and taste better. This recipe be too runny... probably from the whole undrained tomatoes. The only different thing I use be grind turkey in place of hamburger, but I do use italian sausage. If you don&#039;t like this, try my wife more simple recipe: Brown 1-1/2 lbs. of grind turkey &amp; combine in the fry pan, one 24 oz. jar of Ragu spaghetti sauce. In a bowl, combine 2 beat egg with a 12 oz. container of cottage cheese. Boil 6 lasagna noodle accord to package directions. Spray a 13&quot; x 9&quot; bake pan with cook spray. I use olive oil spray. Place 3 lasagna noodle on bottom, then top with meat sauce, follow by the combine egg and cottage cheese. Do the same with the next 3 lasagna noodle etc. Top with grate parmesan cheese. I would guess one cup of parmesan cheese or more if you like. My wife just guess when she make this. This be simple, the spice be in the Ragu sauce and this be cheap to make! Everyone like my wife lasagna, so give it a try! Meatiness, fantastic. But too much marscapone :( i&#039;d try a 3/4 cheese mix by volume next time to get to a happy place for my preferences. That said, easily the best lasagne I&#039;ve ever made. I make before leave for work and ask husband to take out of oven. I receive text at work...&quot;Amazing Lasagna!&quot; -- I don&#039;t think I have ever hear him call my cook amazing. And he come from an Italian &quot;off the boat from Italy&quot; grandmother. &lt;br/&gt;I use my own sauce that I can from my summer garden tomatoes. I compile the rest of the recipe exactly a is. I double the batch so I could freeze dinner since I work nights. This be our &quot;traditional Thanksgiving lasagna&quot;!! My kid be not big turkey eaters, but, a good Italian children, lol, they love their pasta. This year my son be in his 2nd year of college, and he&#039;s look forward to come home for Thanksgiving -- especially for this lasagna! And it&#039;s even good a leftovers! :) With 8 of u for dinner this year, even with an 18 lb. turkey, I&#039;ll be make a double batch. :) You must use ricotta if you want true Italian lasagna.  This recipe be delicious if you use ricotta. Excellent recipe with a few simple tweaks.  Added a cup of tomato sauce and a cup of beef stock to the sauce to make it just a little thin and change the layer order to end with noodles, cheese mixture, sauce and lastly cheese, to keep the noodle from get too dry on top.  Also bake for 25 minute covered, then 25 more uncovered.  Very easy basic recipe to customize to your own taste (I add just a hint of red pepper flake and about a teaspoon of crush rosemary).  Needed a few too many adjustment to be 5 stars, but still a wonderful, tasty recipe for anyone look for a good start point! Really yummy! I add half ricotta and half cottage cheese. I also add a tomato paste can full of water. Next time I will probably double the sauce to have some on top and any leftover sauce would make great sauce over spaghetti! Sad to say yet another online 5 star rat recipe that I follow to the &quot;T&quot; for the first time, and with dinner guest (I should know good by now) It do flow over the side a reviewer mention but also all over the oven bottom (but foil catch most of it but you could smell the burn of the run over yuck) But this turn out dry, just so-so on the flavor and need a lot more cheese filling.  Not one single compliment on the lasagna - thank goodness my other try and true side dish recipe get good reviews. And now that I look at the calorie per serve for this, especially those from fat, wow what be I thinking. There be much good taste lasagna recipe with much le fat. Super yummy and easy to make.   We make it use just hot Italian sausage and it be still super meaty and decadent.   I use no boil lasagna noodle and it turn out perfect. Very good lasagna! I use dice tomato instead of whole and ricotta. It be great. I halve the recipe and wish I make a whole one so there would&#039;ve be more leave over. Very tasty! My husband say that he didn&#039;t taste the sausage in it so if u like more of that flavor add more. I think it be perfect. I can&#039;t wait to make it again! Awesome! I&#039;ve make a lot of pan of lasagna and this recipe be the best. I use the cottage cheese and have to double the sauce because I use my lasagna pan which be a bite larger. I also use the no boil noodles. I cook it for 40 minute covered, uncover the last 5 minute and let it rest for 20 minute before cut it.  &lt;br/&gt;Tip: Don&#039;t try to spread the cheese mixture, drop it by the spoonful and leave it. I use 2 lb grind beef instead of 1.5lbs grind beef &amp; .5lb sausage. It turn out really delicious but I felt like it do not have quite enough salt. Great recipe but if you be omit the sausage, then you may need to increase salt. I grow up make this recipe, and have some tips:\\n1.  The long the sauce cooks, the better.  Try cook it all day or overnight in a slow cooker\\n2.  Use fresh parsley in the filling, it matters!  Also, I add Parmesan cheese and mozzarella to the filling\\n3.  I also make a B&eacute;chamel sauce to spoon over the top.  It balance out the tartness of the tomato sauce\\n4.  I stuff shell and manicotti with this also.  It make enough for 4 family and it&#039;s fun to eat\\n5.  To lighten the fat/calories, I use 1/2 grind turkey and 1/2 grind italian pork sausage and low fat cottage cheese. I be a first-time lasagna maker, and I totally wow my husband. I will definitely find the time to make this again. I do half beef &amp; half sausage, half &amp; half ricotta and cottage cheese, add a little brown sugar to the sauce, add spinach to the cheese mixture, and add one extra can of tomato sauce to make it go a little further. I use oven-ready noodle and didn&#039;t add any extra water or anything; a long a all your noodle be cover in sauce or cheese, it should turn out. I cover my noodle with a tiny bite of sauce (all I have left), then make sure everything be cover by the top cheese, and then cover in foil just to be safe. No crispy noodle for me. I use a really big roast pan because some people mention over-filling a standard 9x13, but I&#039;ll probably go with a 9x13 next time, just to stack everything a little thicker. Seriously, though. No complaints. So good. I be really disappoint with this recipe. Somehow the sauce/meat to cheese proportion be off. I would have prefer le meat and a little more ricotta with one more egg. The ricotta fail to &quot;set&quot; with two eggs. I cook mine for 55 minute and easily could have cook it longer. Even with let it rest for 20 minutes, it be a goopy mess. Not appetizing to look at and not a tasty a I expected. Disappointed I spend so much money for an I satisfy dinner. Easiest recipe to follow ever! I haven&#039;t make homemade lasagna in year and it come out perfect! I love the Italian sausage and beef combo. I use half and half cottage cheese and riccata with a can and a half of water in the tomato paste can. I top the noodle with sauce and the cheese. Baked cover in Gould for 40 minute and then without for 20 just a the author suggested. Delicious!! First time ever make lasagna last night and it come out great with this recipe. Bout to tear into another piece now. Excellent but I use 1 lb of grind deer meat with the Italian sausage and mix cottage and ricotta cheese.  So good. Im so sorry, and I be not try to be mean, but this be awful. We&#039;re minorities, so we love seasoning. I try this the way it be because of the review and it smell amazing. When everyone bite into it their face tell me, This be gross. I try to doctor it up, and nothing worked, never again. I will say Now that I have the basic down I will try my own recipe next time. Thanks for posting. Cooked this this even and all the family love it! great recipe and easy to follow i do add one tin full of water to the meat  and only one pound of meat a per suggest from some of the review and it come out just right not too runny or dry. I will defiantly be cook this again. FANTASTIC! My fiance say &quot;don&#039;t change a thing about it&quot;. That mean alot come from a chef! The batch last the two of u forever and I end up have to make more sauce (which I actually add more sausage to)! I top it with homemade alfredo sauce and now this be go to be a staple. Definitely go to freeze 1/2 right away next time though! I would say if you like a heap of red sauce on top then 1.5 time the sauce recipe (at least!)! OH! And 12 lasagna noodle be PERFECT for a 9 x 13 pan! What the heck be I gonna do with the extra 6 that I made?!!! Oh, Drown them in the extra sauce! YUM!!! Seriously, no doubt about this recipe. \\nPS. I use Ricotta cheese and a Parmesan/Romano blend and spicy Italian sausage. I&#039;m gonna use a bite more italian sausage next time though! That be the ONLY criticism from the man! Love love love this!!!  Best lasagna recipe I&#039;ve ever made! Made this last night after read ton of positive and negative reviews. I use grind turkey and sausage, double the sauce, add 4 table spoon of red wine, and a few pinch of sugar. Sauce be amazing! Oh, I also use can San Marzano tomatoes. I make one huge pan and use leftover sauce to make mini spaghetti squash lasagnas. So good! I love this basic recipe for non cook like me. cottage cheese?? IMO, who in their right (Italian) mind would ever use cottage cheese in place of ricotta/mozzarella?? definitely sub the ricotta and this be a 5 star recipe. I don&#039;t write many reviews...this one be worthy. My wife be well know for her lasagna and she make a very good one. I for sure get a raise eyebrow when I tell her I have make &quot;The Absolute Best Ever&quot; lasagna for dinner:-)\\n\\nI do make it exactly a the recipe call for and I have to say that I be very pleasantly surprised.   As be my wife:-)  If you be not an Italian Grandma you will not likely beat this one! This just become my new &quot;go to&quot; lasagna recipe which I&#039;ve be hunt for.  It be delicious, simple and the flavour aren&#039;t complicated, which I appreciate...it be a great old school meaty/cheesy lasagna!!  My husband &amp; our friend agree, &quot;throw away your other recipe&#039;s that you&#039;ve clipped, save or copy from someone, this be the one&quot;.  Do try the recipe a be the very first time (it appear a though the author have edit it &amp; update it base on other reviewer comments, so trust it, it be current and easy to follow) but also be creative and make it your own next time by add spinach and/or nutmeg to the ricotta mixture...or replace some of the meat with chop portabella mushrooms.  Regardless of how you make it your own, keep this recipe a your base.  It be wonderful and delicious! Fantastic recipe, very easy to follow, taste great!  I add a tsp of garlic powder to the meat sauce.  The long it cook the good it tastes!  I didn&#039;t cover the lasagna and this make the top noodle a bite hard, so definitely recommend cover it a per the recipe.  Thanks! My first attempt at lasagna and for the hubby&#039;s birthday and it be a huge success with this recipe.  He ask me to make sure I make note of any change I make to the recipe so that I be sure to make it exactly the same the next time. The only change I make be I use 1 lb sausage and 1 lb beef, a little more cheese and a little more garlic to our tastes. But, basically follow the recipe to a T. So good! Thank you!!! Absolutely amaze lasagna make by personal chef...  Everyone couldn&#039;t stop rave over how good it was! Very very delish!!  I use 1 lb of beef and sausage drain off must of the oil and follow it pretty much to the letter after that :) I would recommend put the ricotta mixture into the noodle and the meat sauce over that make it way easy to spread and make even on each layer :) This IS the absolute best ever lasagna!  I make it in my 9x13&quot; rectangular crock pot, didn&#039;t boil the lasagna noodles, and add a cup of prepare pasta sauce over each layer of meat sauce to compensate (for the unboiled noodles).  My family love it!  Will definitely add this to my list of favorite recipes! I be a real lasagne lover and have try numerous lasagne recipes, I also have my own recipe that I adore but always want to try something a bite different. I love how this lasagne have ricotta, I love ricotta but I find the ricotta top to be very dry although I follow the direction to the T. Overall I find the whole lasagne to be very dry and lack flavour. I have to add some stock while it be cook because of the lack of liquid. I want to try this again but I&#039;m not sure if it&#039;s worth it. Considering I spend over $25 on the ingredients. This be the first time I have ever make lasagna and it come out beautifully. I absolutely love the Italian sausage in it and it be pretty easy to make. I totally recommend this recipe to anyone who love a good meat and cheese lasagna. I have make this recipe a few time - it be excellent.  I like lot of cheese &amp; add (had to sneak it in) about 3/4 cup crumble blue cheese which add  extra flavour.  Wowed everyone.   Marlene Delicious base recipe. I use ricotta cheese, 2 lb hot Italian turkey sausage, add 3 oz. red wine, garlic powder and onion powder and simmer for 2 hours. Although my family say the lasagna be delicious, next time I will add the remain meat sauce to the final layer of noodle and then the mozzarella cheese to prevent the top from be too bland and firm. Thanks for sharing. The lasagna turn out great! Very beautiful and flavorful. My only problem be that meat to lasagna noodle ratio be too high. I wish I either add more lasagna noodle or use le meat. When you bite into it, it feel like you&#039;re bite into a mouthful of meat and cheese (the recipe recall for 1 1/2lb of beef and 1/2lb of Italian sausage). As much a I like meat, this be an overkill for me. I think next time, instead of use a total of 12 lasagna noodles, I&#039;ll probably use 15 or 18.  Overall, great recipe and thank for sharing. This be my second time make this lasagna recipe.  It be a huge hit the first time with friend and family.  This time Father&#039;s Day Party!  Best lasagna I&#039;ve ever had! Not the best lasagna I&#039;ve ever had!  Just okay.  A bite dry.  I definitely have have much better!!! I really never put review for anything. This lasagna be fantastic, I add 3 can of dice tomato instead of two and a little sugar in the tomato/chopmeat mix while it be simmer to reduce the acidity from the tomatoes. I also use the no bake lasagne pasta and cut up some red bell pepper with the onion and garlic.... come out fantastic, will make this again with different type of cheeses. Have use a similar recipe for years. For the sauce, I use an 8oz can of tomato sauce, and 28oz can crush tomatoes, and only put sugar, salt, parsley and basil in it. Simmer uncover for 45 minutes. Put the oregano in the cottage cheese/ricotta mixture (I use half and half with no egg). I add a little sauce to the pan, and then layer no bake noodles, meat sauce, mozzarella, and cottage cheese mixture. I bake it at 350 uncover for 45 minute This be the most delicious lasagna I&#039;ve ever taste or made, my husband be very happy and he would stop praise my cook !\\nI make few change though, I double the amount of oregano and basil, add 1 tea spoon of sugar to the sauce, it so delicious that you won&#039;t be able to stop eat ! I have be teach myself how to cook and think I would give lasagna a try. I use this recipe after the entice photo catch my eye. I be a little confuse at the term &quot;divided in regard to the mozzarella cheese, and didn&#039;t realize there be an entirely separate pan make just for lasagna. However, I be able to make this recipe. It be really easy to work through - even for a beginner like me, and it be absolutely DELICIOUS! Thank you so much for the family recipe. Five star over and over! This be very good. If you want to add another dimension of taste mix in a cup of hollandaise sauce to the Ricotta Cheese mixture and it just pop with flavor. Tried it for my family didn&#039;t think I can do it even though I  cut up itilian link in stead of put in Italian sausage mix with lean grind beef it still come out really really good the kid love it and so do I. Easy and quick didn&#039;t know they have the skinner lasagna pasta that you don&#039;t have to boil that cut the time on the cooking. This lasagna be so tasty! The crazy part be it actually keep taste good the long it be leave over. It give the flavor more of a chance to mix together and get stronger. It be very easy to make! I highly recommend this recipe. This be the first time I&#039;ve ever make lasagna and I like it good than any other lasagna I&#039;ve had!! Awesome!!! I make this for dinner last night, and it be a huge hit. I did, however change the recipe a little. Instead of the recommend amount of meat, I put in one pound each of the grind beef and Italian sausage. I also put in four clove of garlic. I will definitely make this again!!! Delicious! Made exactly a written! Thanks! Easy to follow, great results. The most important thing that I want to point out be that it take my friend and I four hour to complete the prep.  However, it make my kitchen smell like it be in the heart of Italy.  I do not advise watch a movie while make this recipe because it require all of your attention.  **DISCLAIMER: Have not put it in the oven or actually try recipe yet.** This be delicious.  I do add fresh chop plum tomato to the sauce.  We don&#039;t have good Italian sausage here on the island, so I add fennel, pepper flake to grind pork to get some of that sausage taste.  Came out great! Is the amount of tomato paste correct in this? It seem to be a lot. Unless tomato paste be different in the U.S. to Australia?  Really want to make this though. Would really appreciate any help I use 28 oz crush tomatoes, the chop 6 fresh tomatoes, also add a can of tomato sauce. (We like ours more saucy),. Yum yum This be so good, and easy! I do half ricotta and half cottage cheese. Instead of make my own sauce, I buy a big jar of  spaghetti sauce. Just amazing! Okay I have to admit...I completely surprise myself tonight. My other half choose lasagna for me to make for dinner...the only problem be 1) I have never make lasagna, 2) I don&#039;t eat meat, and 3) I be go to have to use fresh herb from the garden...which I really haven&#039;t do much. So make a real lasagna from scratch be go to be a challenge to say the least. Four hour later...er...dinner at 9 p.m...we sit down at the table and have some amaze lasagna and here be the big surprise of all, I eat some of it and like it! Crazier thing have happened, but this be a great surprise for me. Oh and we have a ton of the stuff leave over so it look like we will be have lasagna again tomorrow. We use fresh herb from our garden and just add to the delicious flavor. Very good recipe. Tasted delicious. Oh wow!  This get 20 star out of 10 at my house tonight :)  I love the praise and accolade that follow a yummy dish devoured! :)  Thank you for this recipe!!!  Everyone love it!  My mom love it so much she be actually curse at the table lmao!!!!  :)  Awesome night.  Thank you for make me look good!!!!! Mediocre result for a time intensive recipe.  We expect &quot;Wow&quot; but get &quot;Ehh&quot;...I immediately have memory of Costco freeze lasagna, comparatively speaking. I use quality beef sausage and cheese from whole foods, make this a bite of a pricey medeocre dish.\\n\\nI be draw to this recipe base on reviews. It&#039;s ALL meat no vegetable unless you add a several of u have.  I figure add a good amount of roast zucchini would make a great lasagna, but disappoint base on the time and ingredient we used. It&#039;s not bad, but there be a lot of good recipe out there. Going back and stick to veggie  lasagna recipes....... THIS IS THE BEST! LITERALLY BEST! I cook this for my boyfriend every time he want lasagna. It be his favorite food, and I have try different recipes. He be VERY picky and this recipe have BLOWN u both away. He LOVES it and so do I! It be worth all the time and effort put into it! Thanks for save my bad cooking! This be my first lasagna recipe. I make it two week ago and I&#039;m make it again right now. I make a few change since I&#039;m a little picky. I only use grind beef, add sugar to the sauce and use Half ricotta and half cottage cheese. That make a huge difference. Best lasagna ever! Also layer pepperoni and olive a per my boyfriend&#039;s request. He love it! This will be my go to lasagna recipe. Also I do not have tinfoil so I flip another metal bake pan on top and low the temp to 350   and it work fine. A wonderful recipe that get 5 star from everyone this Thanksgiving! The mix of grind beef and chop up Italian sausage make the meat sauce special. I also love that this recipe be so flexible. I add a couple of layer of fresh spinach and substitute some cheddar and havarti I have in the fridge for about half of the mozzerella in the recipe. It turn out great! As other reviewer suggested, I add a bite more liquid (about a cup of water) since I be use oven-ready lasagna pasta. You might need a tiny bite more because I suspect the spinach also help add some moisture. It be still a thick, rich meat sauce, so I be worry that the pasta would be dry, but a it turn out, it be perfect. 100% success! Ok, I wouldn&#039;t classify myself a a lasagna fan, that be say I&#039;ve always want to make it for the challenge of it. I&#039;ve be tell my whole life that make lasagna be a difficult and daunt task. This be not only relatively easy to make but it be DELICIOUS!!!! It make a huge batch, in fact we because we be only 2 adult and one child we think to freeze what be leave over, but it be go within 2 days!!!! We never even get a chance to freeze it!  I follow the recipe exactly and be super pleased, however, upon late appraisal of the dish we decide that it be a tad dry, the next time we make it (hopefully tonight), I will add more tomato and another layer of sauce a a last layer under the cheese for more moisture! All in all though this be an AMAZING recipe!!! Good Show!!! Best lasagna recipe I&#039;ve tried. I add one more can of dice tomato and 1 cup of water to the sauce a I like lot of meaty sauce in my lasagna. It&#039;s a family favorite! My mom even ask me to come make it for her now. It come out pretty good. I leave it uncover for 10 min....the top get too hard...that be the only thing I didn\\'t like, but it be hit with my husband and one of my boys...(only cuz the other 2 be really picky) This be my first time ever make lasagna. I make sure to carefully follow the recipe exactly, so no change to it on my part. I have to say that I have no idea how expensive and laborious it be to make lasagna - I didn&#039;t have a lot of the ingredient on hand, so have to go to the store to pick up whatever I be missing, and the total be about $50, exclude of course the stuff I already had. The total time from start to finish, include all prep work and let the lasagna rest for 20 minute after baking, be around 4 hours. It be WELL worth the money, time and effort though! This was, hand down, the BEST lasagna I&#039;ve ever had! My wife agree and say I be the official lasagna maker from now on. Her sister have previously hold the title for best lasagna, but she say I steal the crown. Since most thing be even good the next day, we can&#039;t wait to see how it taste tomorrow! Don&#039;t be fool by the over-the-top name! This recipe be mediocre at best! First, the ratio be off and it make way too much fill for a normal lasagna pan. Second, mix the egg with the ricotta and mozzerella cheese give the cheese a weird quiche-like texture and reduce the gooey, cheesy texture that you want in a good lasagna. Third, the fill isn&#039;t very saucy, mostly just some grind beef with some tomato mix in, and then they top the whole thing with the noodle above the sauce. At least they say to top with mozzerella, but it&#039;s not enough to keep the noodle from dry out! So, if you want a bunch of grind beef layer with some weird quiche-like semi-cheese stuff top with dry noodles, go ahead and make this dish! I would give this one star, but because they be overselling the recipe with a self-serving, undeserved title of &quot;Absolute best ever lasagna&quot;, I&#039;m take that one star away! Me and my husband make this and it be amazing. ..i recommend this too anybody...thanks Was good the next day reheated. Now try not the great cook,  but egg in lasagna first for me,  give outcome later. ? 510 people cannot be wrong! This be the best lasagna I&#039;ve ever had! This be the first lasagna that I&#039;ve ever make that be really, really good. Other recipe be just okay. I use ready-to-cook noodle and they come out perfect without add any extra water. The season be right on the money, lot of flavor, and I&#039;m sure it will be even good tomorrow. I use 1# grind beef and 1# mild sausage, so I add a 1/2 tsp of crush red pepper. And I add about 12 oz of thawed, squeezed-dry spinach to the cheese mixture. I bake it at 375, cover 35 minute and uncover 25 minutes. Perfect!! I let it sit for 15 minute before I cut it. I can finally make a good lasagna! This be by far the best lasagna recipe... The meat sauce alone could double a spaghetti sauce. Yum yum! No offence to the author of this recipe. I don&#039;t like put down other peoples&#039; taste but this be terrible! It be dry and the top noodle and cheese crisp into a shingle like consistency. Good thing be be that it allow me to make a &quot;redemption&quot; lasagna from a good recipe. Don&#039;t waste your time on this one unless you aren&#039;t familiar with &quot;good&quot; lasagna. Very good recipe. I do make a couple revision to the sauce. I add a half pound of breakfast sausage in place of Italian sausage, a I do not care for Italian sausage, and I add 1 tablespoon of sugar to offset some of the acidity from the tomatoes. Came out perfect. I be very happy with the result of this lasagna.  I make it for a small dinner party with great success, pair with Caesar salad and garlic bread.  Everyone love it! So rich and delicious, the use of 3 cheese in the cheese sauce be a brilliant idea. As be the use of two type of meat! I use fresh parsley instead of dried, ricotta instead of cottage cheese and tasty cheese instead of mozzarella, and I cook the cheese sauce on the stave a bite like a b&eacute;chamel sauce. I melt some butter in the pan first and then add the cheeses, stir until melt and then add a pinch of nutmeg, about 1/3 milk and then the rest of the ingredients, leave the whisk egg until last and stir consistently so a not to scramble them. Also stir some spinach through the meat sauce just before make the lasagne layers. Absolutely sensational lasagne! Will never use another recipe again! I make this twice so far and we love it. Best lasagna recipe I\\'ve find so far and easy to make. YUM. Made this polenta instead of noodle and all italian sausage, no beef. So tasty. If I could give this 10 star I would. It really truly be the best lasagna recipe I\\'ve ever try (and I\\'ve try a bunch). I\\'m go to start make the sauce a my spaghetti sauce a well. What a gem....THANK YOU for sharing! I never write review for thing but I just have to for this! I\\'ve be want to make lasagne for so long and I finally decide to do it today. I literally type into google best lasagne recipe in the world haha and this be the second I think.. I follow it exactly except I didn\\'t use parsley because I didn\\'t have any but oh my god! It\\'s amazinggg! Literally one of the best lasagna recipe I\\'ve ever had. The amount in this recipe be enough to make that size pan they say plus I have enough to make another small pan because I accidentally take out to much beef and macaroni lol.. But yay more for later. Highly suggested! This be simply the best lasagna I\\'ve ever eaten. Thank you for the recipe !!! Followed this recipe exactly (including the foil step) and mine look exactly like the picture! My boyfriend and I both love it. It be fairy easy, but you do need the recommend cook time for both the meat mixture and full lasagna itself. In the future I would like to serve this with an extra bowl of sauce which would also come in handy for reheat to keep the lasagna moist. Will make again! I find the cheesy too hard to my liking. Well, I modify the recipe because I don\\'t like cottage cheese (nor ricotta). In fact I don\\'t like a lot of cheese in general. I use bechamel sauce instead (I think my recipe make about 17-18 ounce sauce) in place of the cottage cheese. I also cut the mozzarella in half... it be great and just right for someone who doesn\\'t like cheese. Thanks for a fabulous recipe. : ) I didn\\'t really love this, I don\\'t like Italian sausage in meat pasta sauces, plain ol grind beef be best for me. I prefer my lasagne classic, with a proper bechamel sauce. I be not a cook but I know how to follow a recipe. This lasagna come out fantastic. My mom would have be so proud (and surprised). I do only one change; substitute a half pound of grass-fed, grind lamb for a half pound of grass-fed, grind beef. Used cottage cheese not ricotta. I can\\'t wait to eat the leftovers. Sooo good! I make this for my family, and it be a big hit. I follow most of the recipe a listed, but add a few substitutions. I use grind turkey and turkey sausage, since our family doesn\\'t eat beef. When use turkey, I use the 85% lean because it have more flavor. However, I still use extra season to make sure the meat have a good hearty taste. I also use Ragu Mushroom Spaghetti Sause and a can of dice basil tomato instead of the tomato sauce and paste. I use the extra sauce to pour over the dish, once it be plated. My family love extra sauce on everything. I must say, this recipe be perfect. We all love it. This be a perfectly great lasagna no modification need absolutely delicious , I don\\'t understand but I guess some people to want complain about everything, if you don\\'t like pork or cheese why do you even attempt to make this recipe? SMH . . . anyways guy great recipe, keep up the good work I\\'m gonna try this for the New Year! Thanks for all the great reviews, I enjoy read them all. You all review make my decision for me. I love this recipe! The only change be small curd cottage cheese for the ricotta, a my HB do not like ricotta. Lasagna be a hit! Great hearty meal that will have many come back for seconds. I make this last night and it be pretty easy. First time I have make lasagna. The only herb I use be basil and no sugar. My bf and I love it and he say it\\'s the best lasagna he\\'s tried. SO GOOD. This will be my go to lasagna recipe. Unbelievable!!!! Insanely good, rich, meaty and delicious! This really be the best lasagna ever. I be so disappoint with this recipe. How on earth it have so many good review be absolutely beyond me. The cheesy &quot;sauce&quot; be so dry it do not resemble anything near a sauce. I be ashamed to serve this and wish I have or stick to my usual lasagne recipe with Bechamel sauce. This be nowhere near the &quot;best lasagne&quot;, and be not a hit with anyone in my household who try it. Don\\'t bother. I be excite to try this recipe, give all the great reviews. I follow the instruction and use the ingredient (in my case, ricotta) a listed. The lasagna come out very dry. I be really disappointed. The sauce be miss liquid. If I be to make it again, I\\'d add a large can of tomato sauce and maybe some beef broth. Absolutely bad lasagna ever! Save yourself the 2 and a half hour and buy a premade store bought. Super dry. Recommend any other on recipe online. Incredible recipe. It be moist, combination of flavor be spot on, it be moreish, very fill and the whole family love it. I follow the recipe pretty much exactly (took a bite of liberty with the herbs, spice and parmesan) and it turn out awesome. Dry? - definitely if you use the wrong type of noodle. Use &quot;OVEN READY&quot; pasta not regular which require a lot more liquid Made this for the second time today and love it. Did make one minor tweak - I have errand to run, so instead of simmer on the stove, I put the sauce in the slow cooker on low for 4 hours. Worked out perfectly. I have make this recipe 7x now and will continue to do so until I can\\'t afford it! I make 2 full pan eacheck time and take one into work to share with fellow supervisors. I do change recipe some. I add 1: 8 ounce can of tomato sauce and I use both ricotta and cottage cheese so I be double the cheese! The 1st time I make this, it be so dry and hard that my son pour a jar of salsa over his portions. Thinking it might be my error, I make it again. Nope. Still crunchy and inedible. My suggestion: Go to the NY Times recipe website and find the Regina Schrambling lasagne recipe. You won\\'t be sorry. Yup. The title didn\\'t lie. Even my mom agrees. Best ever. I think the other &quot;crunchy&quot; reviewer forget to fully cover with foil while it cooked. I buy cheap, generic lasagna sheet and they cook just fine. (40 minute in steam would cook any pasta. Lasagna or not.) Yuck, Cottage Cheese...onion.....Most of all......CANNED.....Tomatoes! This be a good flavorful recipe all in all. I be rat off the recipe given. I give 4 star bc the instruction be a little off and after make a is, for taste purpose I decide a few thing I\\'d prefer changing. You\\'ll have to add more liquid depend how long you decide to cook the sauce. I cook a instruct and find I need to add about one can of tomato worth of water. (Bc the noodle once bake will continue to soak up liquid). I like mine a little saucy. Also, 2 TBSP of brown sugar cut the and be a must. Might seem like a lot but it\\'s not. To smooth out the sauce I add about 1/3 cup cream (half n half). Bake time and temp work great. &gt;&gt;Not re: the rating, I prefer to add another 1/2 lb mozzarella than what\\'s instruct on the top bc we like ours cheesy! (Not change the fill recipe). Great recipe to start and modify how you like. Thank you for share it! This be my first attempt, I cheat and use bake ready noodle but it be still amazing. the family love it and seem like it will go in my rotation for big dinner Rave review from the family! Made 2 pan of this for Mother\\'s day and it go well. FYI - I make 1 pan with boil noodle and the other with no-boil noodles. Similar result and taste. We enjoy the taste vey good! I think next time I\\'m gonna add tomato sauce, I miss have a little bite more sauce. Other then that it\\'s great!! My family love it!! And I love have leftovers!! The flavor be amazing. I use cottage cheese instead of ricotta. We will definitely be save this recipe. Sick of eat gross freeze lasagna, so give this a shot. All I can say is....wow, very delicious! My husband be a picky eater and he really love it! A friend of mine also try it and be impressed. Definitely go to be regularly cook here at my house. I use grind turkey instead of beef, crush tomato with basil and tomato sauce. FANTASTIC!!! The meatsauce be perfect..The ritual have be a while since I have make my lasagna, and I need a visual reminder of how to prepare it. And 5his recipe NAILED IT!!! My family be so please with it that they even notice that the Ricotta Cheese mixture instead of a Cottage Cheese be SOOOO TASTY!!!! I WILL USE THIS RECIPE AGAIN.. DEFINITELY... I almost always host Sunday dinner and there be usually leftovers.. Not with this.. Everybody could not stop get second and thirds.. This be definitely a recommend dish in my house now.. Made this recipe before. Friends and family love it! Made extra meat sauce and serve it on the side. I also add extra mozzarella cheese between each layer. It\\'s really be fantastic As write it be too dry. I would add lot more tomato sauce. Fantastic! I normally require a saucy lasagna (love marinara!), but this one be so good without have sauce drip out on all sides. Everyone love it. Delicious! Thanks for the recipe. I make this lasagna for a church fellowship service today and everyone LOVED IT. I follow the direction just a the recipe said. The flavor be very on the spot. The sauce be very soft, do not taste like can tomato a other recipe I try in the past. I do use 4 fresh tomato to give it a fresh taste and balance out the meat quantity on the sauce. The ricotta cheese mix be a bite short to cover up two layers. Next time instead of 24oz, I would use the whole 28oz of ricotta. Anyhow, delicious! This come together so easily. The most tasty and simple lasagna I\\'ve made. This turn out amazingly! I use fresh herb since I have them. I receive rave review from my family. They say the sauce be nice and light and didn\\'t overpower the meal. I also use fresh mozzarella slice in between layers. I make one with meat and one without. Both be great! Very disappoint ..Is there supppse to be tomato paste or sauce?? Followed recipe and it be very dry and bland. Hands down this be by far my favorite lasagna recipe. It\\'s easy and always turn out perfect. My grandson request it several time every month and it\\'s the number one request at family get togethers. It say brown grind beef and then add tomatoes. Do you strain the grind beef first? Or leave the grease? I use slightly more cheese 32oz ricotta and a touch more of the others. Super Delicious Meal! Pared with fresh salad I prepare and fresh Italian loaf from my local super market! My favorite lasagna recipe. I use it frequently. I do it 3 ways, just ricotta, just cottage, and a 1/2 and 1/2 mixture of both. I prefer the cottage the best. Making it today for our daughter family a she just have a new baby and could use a home cook meal! Followed everything, come out very bland, didn\\'t like it. This be very bland and dry. After spend all of the money to make this dish, I be very disappointed. It need a red sauce. The recipe only call for 2 undrained can of whole tomatoes. Even at an Italian restaurant, lasagna have some kind of red sauce in it. Once baked, it look very pretty, but taste be disappointing. Felt that it need tomato paste or tomato sauce this be truly the best that I have try in 63 years! Lots or option to make it your own, family love it!! True 5 star yall Everyone have thirds!! One friend say his ex-wife\\'s family own an Italian restaurant. He say this be good than theirs and good than he have ever had. It be soooooo good!! I think the meat/sauce combo be too dry and in turn make the lasagna MEH at best. I\\'ll forego this lasagna in the future for another saucy recipe. Good grief. This be a really, really, really good lasagne. I make it base on the review even though the ingredient didn\\'t seem that &quot;wow&quot; to me and I will never make another lasagne in my life. I use spicy italian sausage, &quot;italian seasoning&quot; instead of the parsley/oregano/basil, add aleppo pepper to the ricotta and use gluten free noodles. Otherwise, I be true to the recipe. ;) Winner winner, lasagne dinner. Now if I can just figure out how to make a vegetarian one a yummy for my veggie friends..... Far from the best lasagana ever. Mine turn out too dry. The can tomato didn’t really cut it for a sauce. We absolutely love this dish. I use 2 lb of the Italian sausage and omit the grind beef. I also add marinara sauce to the meat mixture. Delicious!! My Dad say he want Lasagna. I pick this one out of 4 or 5 other recipes. I\\'m eat it a I type this. Lives up to it\\'s name. No addition need it be very flavorful without be overly salty or spicy. Will be make this regularly. I use no bake lasagna noodle and it turn out perfectly. Also use fresh mozzarella make a huge difference. This be a keeper! I be not able to do much these days, so my fourteen year old son make this recipe with my direction exactly a posted. It be the best lasagna we\\'ve have so far. In fact, lasagna along with meatloaf be something I\\'m always try to do better. This be it. Thank you. We love it! I make this recipe a few year ago and recall it have cottage cheese and tomato sauce/paste. I be really surprise when I come back to this link and find those ingredient missing! For the cottage cheese, I omit it the first time, anyway, so that wasn\\'t a big deal. Instead, I like to add a brick of cream cheese (just like my momma\\' use to!) The first time it really be a spectacular lasagna, but this time, without the tomato sauce/paste, it be miss a little something. The can of tomatoes, for me, just wasn\\'t enough. Unlike others, however, my lasagna still come out well and not too dry. But, while I will definitely make this again, I\\'ll be sure to add in some more tomato. Also, I use turkey instead of grind beef just to make it a smidge healthier. Good stuff! Very good lasagna. The only problem I have with it be the lack of tomato sauce like flavor and texture in the meat mixture. I think a can of tomato paste would solve that problem. Made this tonight turn out great. I add mushroom to the meat mix and a single layer of baby spinach before the last layer of noodles. I use no boil noodle next time will not put the last layer before the noodle This have be my go-to lasagna recipe for over ten years. I want to double-check the time requirements, so I quickly look it up online. I be dismay at all the recent low review and quickly realize that the recipe have be altered. I go back to my print copy and notice that the 2 (6 ounce) can of tomato paste be no long listed. Also, the recipe use to recommend 24 ounce of ricotta OR cottage cheese. I\\'ve make with each and sometimes a mix with great results. I\\'ve submit a correction in the hop that future user won\\'t have dry, bland sauce. Do you add the 2 can of tomato sauce with the chop tomato or eliminate the chop tomato and use sauce only? Love this recipe! Everyone rave about it whenever I make it. Tastes really good. I always add tomato paste and always add a little bite more of everything (I measure, then add a tiny bite more without measuring). One thing I always sort of miss though be the top layer. I put mozzarrela on top, but mine somehow doesn\\'t end up look like the picture others have post with a creamy-looking top layer. What do you guy put? Any tip and suggestion to share? We go meatfree. And this be a great recipe - even without the meat! We add some fresh basil on top of ours before enjoy and it be delicious! Also, I add some sugar to the red gravy, just because I like my lasagna and ziti a little sweet than I do normal macaroni. Ok..some reviewer seem confused, unless the author revise the recipe I just read. One say it call for too much salt, say shouldn\\'t add to meat then more to cheese. I didn\\'t read anything such. It call for 1tsp in meat sauce, period. Also, many say it need to be cover with foil first..well, the recipe state to cover it for the first 40min. I be not sure what those reviewer be talk about! I will say the paste and can of water tip be useful, a well a cover top noodle with just enough sauce to not dry out..but in recipe defense, it do say to cover noodle completely or they will. Would never add dry oregano to a pasta sauce recipe. Oregano be in my meatball recipe - once stir my sauce forget I have the meatball in the sauce. Broke them up - it ruin the sauce. This recipe be great. A lot like mine, however, I add a pound of mushroom and I use jar marinara sauce. Not enough tomato and sauce , too dry',\n",
       " ' Oh these be good--very rich and smooth.  I use Caillebaut chocolate, Tia Maria and espresso--the coffee flavor be very subtle.  One or two of these make an extraordinary finish to a meal.',\n",
       " \" No one in my family like this.  It have a strange oder but it be pretty. It seem too cheesy and the carrot seem out of place. \\r\\nIt would probably be good if you replace the carrot with potatoes. \\r\\nI don't see the point of have white corn you can't really see the different color of the corn.  \\r\\n My family love it! I do not have white corn on hand, so I use only yellow. I also add a can of dice chicken and it work perfectly a a whole-meal casserole. Will make again for sure. Thanks Wildflour!\",\n",
       " ' This be very good consider I mess it up a little bite (cooked in the crock pot too long). It be nice to throw it in and forget it! I don\\'t recommend Granny Smith Apples! Something sweet be much better.   This be a wonderful and easy recipe to make.  My house smell heavenly while it be cooking.  I pair it with Roast pork loin and potato recipe#50284 by barbara in sonora.  What a wonderful dinner we had. I have a surplus of apple so I decide to try this recipe.\\r\\nIt be so yummy!  My kid love it!! Great recipe. This be good, and it couldn\\'t have be any easier.  But somehow, it didn\\'t turn out quite a good a when I make it on the stave top.  Perhaps because I can adjust the sugar & cinnamon a I go when I make it the \"regular\" way?  But I still like the concept of use the slow cooker & may try again. Super simple!  I also add a bite of nutmeg and some dry lemon and orange rind to give it a bite more flavor. Loved this!  I make it with organic Granny Smiths and organic sugar, and it taste fabulous!  Sorry to say that I eat more than DS did, he be very upset!  Would definitely make this again, just the way it be (and definitely use the cinnamon)! this be very very good  thank wonderful applesauce and so easy in the crockpot!  I have a lot of apples, so i fill the crockpot almost to the top, add 3/4 cup of water, 3/4 cup of splenda and 1 teaspoon of cinnamon, mmm mmm good!!!!  I use my motor boat to puree it, but leave some lumps.  DH love it and so do I, it be great this morning on toast and will be wonderful on morning oatmeal and so many other way to use it.  Packed it into zip lock bag and will freeze it.  Thanks for posting!! Great use of the crockpot for this applesauce! Added a little le sugar and double the recipe. Delicious! Thanks! This be GREAT!  I have some apple around that be start to get a little soft and didn\\'t want to throw them out.  I make this recipe which turn out so good!  The next night, I make #365376 - Crockpot applesauce chicken.  Great combo! Thank you!  I be very satisfy with the recipe and love the cocept. I do make one alteration...I do not use a crock-pot/slow-cooker.  A rice cooker be use instead and it work great. Living in SE Asia the rice cooker be more accessible for me.  &lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Results:  The applesauce cook faster, but you do have to watch the water content.  My rice cooker have a glass lid so monitor be not an issue.',\n",
       " \" sound delish. I intend to try real soon These be really good! My BF ask me if he could help in the kitchen the other night so I hand him the lap top and tell him to make these for desert. LOL, apparently he didn't feel the need to read the directions. He just dump every thing in bowl and start mixing. No sifting, No creaming. Well luckily they turn out just fine. I will definitely make these again. Perhaps with no help next time. ;) These be a big hit!\",\n",
       " ' Shelby this be a very light textured cake - almost to the point a bite more moisture to hold it together would not be a bad thing.  Overall the flavor be excellent - nice spice and the wheat flour just give it another notch up.  With your permission I use almond in place of the pecan and it turn out wonderful in the topping!  I love that this cake be not overly sweet so it make a perfect breakfast treat but also a nice light dessert with coffee.  So glad I tag this be Photo Tag. Very good cake. I think that the alllspice make it different from other streusel cakes. I do add a splash of milk to the batter just to make it a little moist  for my husband and it come out very good. Made for Bevy Tag. I make several change to the recipe, white flour only, yogurt instead of sour cream, jumbo egg 2 whole+1 white. I double the streusel. Next time in the cake I will double the spice and/or use part brown sugar. It be a bite plain for my taste. I will make this again.',\n",

Rather than measure carefully, I just dump 3 or 4 T. mayo, a heap tsp. of dijon, a little Italian parsley and 2 big basil leave in a mini- processor and twirl it a few times.  (That be more than enough spread for 2 extra-large sandwiches.) I use smoke turkey, bacon and Swiss, and brush the bread with olive oil.  The only way I really deviate from the recipe be by add about a tsp. of hot pepper relish to each serve for a little kick.  My son take one bite, muttered, \"Killer!  Absolutely killer!\" -- and then didn\\'t come up for air again until he\\'d devour every crumb.  Can\\'t wait wntil tomato be in season.  That will add yet another layer of yumminess.  Thank you so much, Pets!  You definitely help confirm the fact that I *needed* that panini.  :) Mouthwatering! I make Ham and Swiss Paninis use the George Foreman. Loved the herb sauce (I use fresh parsley). I didn\\'t bother with the bacon but it wasn\\'t missed. You can\\'t go wrong with this one! I personally think the Mayonnaise be a little too much, so instead, I use a 1/4 cup Dijon mustard with 1/4 cup of Mayonnaise and add olive oil to the outside bread sides. Calls also for a low fat option! Really great, probably would have be good have I remember the turkey : )  I keep wonder why it wasn\\'t a \"club\" sandwich until I remembered...  but be be really good.  I think the recipe writer mean Dijon mustard, at least that\\'s what I used. I love this, I make it then be crave it so I make it again the next day! I make a half recipe, and I use fresh basil from the garden for the \"fresh herbs\". I also add finely slice red onion. Then I spray some olive oil spray directly onto the bread and put it in the grill. Yummy! I would eat this every day if it didn\\'t have so much fat LOL This be a fantastic meal.  I only use one piece of swiss and add half a piece of american and half a piece of pepperjack.  I also put lettuce on this sandwich.  I be a little skeptical about the mayo on the outside, but I try it anyways and it be so yummy!!! Tried to low the fat a bit... so use turkey bacon and a lot le mayo!!  Used a nice small loaf of French bread and some nice swiss cheese.  Also use sun dry tomato a it\\'s hard to find some nice tomato in December!  Thanks Pets\\'R\\'us this be :yummy:!! :) Yumm! These panini\\'s be delicious! The only thing I do differently be not add the herb in the mayo.I  cook mine in a George Foreman.

Thanks Pets\\'R\\'us!! This be a great panini!!! I serve it at a family gather & it be a wonderful hit with all.  Thanks for posting! Great panini.  I use sourdough bread (my favorite).  The mayo-herb spread be what make all the difference in this sandwich, don\\'t be tempt to leave it out or skimp on it. We use ham in place of the turkey breast and leave off the Dijon mustard. Fantastic sandwich Pets!  Thanks for share it!  Mike this be sooo delicous! i make it for my entire family\\r\\nI ever-so-slightly spread mayonaisse on the top-instead of musterd(sp?) i use horse raddish!amazing! also i use ham and i think thats the tasty option. thank you pets\\'r\\'us, for a delicous, filling,easy,quick meal-btw it take more like 3 minute prep time if u use george formen grill. I love the combo of mayo mustard and herb on this.  I didn\\'t have bacon, tomatoes, or swiss.  I sub ham and mozz and cheddar.  Regardless, it be still very good! My husbend, and I really like this recipe. We cook it on our gorge formen grill which be very fast and easy. With the sauce I add more dijon mustard for more flavor. Is this serve near a hospital with a crash cart....might be good once but if it become an addiction your artery will be hard in no time Very tasty! I make these on the George Foreman grill use Italian Parmesan Bread (recipe #155369). I didn\\'t have any fresh herb on hand, so I just mix a little mayo and the mustard til it taste good to me. Great combo of ingredients! I do find this very rich and I do make only 1/2 the spread and skip the bacon. Sorry this wasn`t my kind of meal. I do enjoy all the herbs. We really enjoy this Panini.  I didn\\'t really measure anything, just mix the mayo and mustard to my like then add the rest.  I use a little Olive Oil spray on the outside of the bread and that work great.  Thanks Pet :) This be awesome! Don\\'t listen to the hater who post about need a crash cart or how it be bad because they leave off ingredient therefore change the sammie. It\\'s great!! Yum!  I didn\\'t use quite a much a the ingredient stated, because my bread slice weren\\'t very big.  I use sourdough bread, brush the outside with olive oil, and inside the sandwich I layer 2 slice of turkey, 2 slice of shortcut bacon, and 3 slice of tomato, with a small slice of swiss cheese between each layer.  The herbed mayo be fantastic (I couldn\\'t decide which herb to use, so I use a combination of fresh basil, fresh parsley, and fresh chives!).  Made in memory of Pet\\'R\\'Us. This be very good. Instead of cook bacon I add real bacon piece  to the mayonnaise<br/>Mixture.I also use panini bread and cook it on a panini maker. Both my husband and my son felt it be a keeper. Can you say YUMMY?  I make a half recipe, but only use a quarter of the mayonnaise, mustard, and herb mixture which be plenty.  I use fresh chive for the herbs, didn\\'t measure, and wish I have use at least a much a be call for.  I do spread mayonnaise on the outside before frying.  This be a quick and delicious weeknight dinner for DH and I. Thanks Pets.  I didn\\'t know you but be honor to have make one of your recipes. Very tasty. I use Rosemary and Olive Oil artisan bread and oven roast turkey (the good stuff) from Costco, 1 slice Swiss and 1 slice Monterrey jack, and about 1/2 the mayo mix, dry parsley instead of fresh herb and butter before frying/squishing in the waffle iron with the flat plates. I didn\\'t have any bacon but I\\'m sure that would have be even better. Served with cheese and potato soup for a birthday dinner. Sooooo good.  I make soup and sandwich the other night for dinner and we love these.  I really like the sauce for these sandwiches.  We will make this again, a we all really like them.  Thank you for share with us. Basil olive oil, parsley and chive in the low-fat mayo mix (which I spread on the inside of both and the outside of one slice just to be annoyingly different) be my deviation from the recipe and these make in the panini press turn out really well. Unfortunately, the bread slice we have be HUUUUGE, so neither of u could finish more than half a sandwich.... which, eyeball the calorie count, be probably a bless in disguise. ;o) Very tasty, though!

Also, I add some additional salt, some black pepper, and a little sugar. The end result be a salad I will definitely make again. We really love the zinginess that the chipotle pepper added. Thank you for share this great salad. Made for My-3-Chefs. I also chop the onion and add some grate garlic and olive oil to the dressing.  I omit the corn a I do not like it and add some chop red bell pepper.  I use grape tomato cut in half.  I also toast the quinoa after rinse it.  Nice nutty flvor. Really yummy, but do agree with another reviewer who think it be a little dry and need a little tweaking.  I also add some additional salt, pepper, olive oil and a little sugar. I also use chipotle pepper powder a I didn't have canned.  Yum!  Thanks Melissa for a great recipe! I&#039;m sorry, this be not a review but a question:  Do you blend all of the dress ingredients?  I ask because I believe that the chilies in adobo sauce be whole.  If I be incorrect, please forgive me and let me know.  I have buy these in the past and the chilies be whole.  This be why I be asking. Thank you.\",\n",

Very nice stir-fry! I just happen to have a little fresh asparagus and fresh pineapple leave over from a birthday celebration. This be perfect. The sauce be quick and delicious, not too sweet.

This recipe be really good and really easy!  It taste a lot like the Applebee\\'s version!  I will definitely be make this again! Just finish eat this amazingly delicious recipe and for the first time ever I decide to write a review.  It be so good.  Followed the recipe exactly a post except for the tequila-didn\\'t have any.  I do go out to my local store and buy liquid smoke and I have to say that make all the difference.  I use a Mexican cheese mix and it be so good.  I let the chicken marinate for about 12 hour and that also help the flavor penetrate.  I think it might be good than the restaurant. I love this meal.  I be always a bit\\r\\nconservative with the spice I use\\r\\nbecause I have 2 picky eaters.\\r\\nSome of the spice be new to \\r\\nmy pantry.  But, now that I made\\r\\nthis meal...I will definately be make this dish again.\\r\\nThanks Mirela for introduce me\\r\\nto this great website.\\r\\nPaula G. NJ Just want to let you know that I use to work in the kitchen at Applebees & the \\'Mexi-Ranch\" Dressing they use to top the chicken be just ranch dress mix with salsa.  I know you have another concoction that sound good, but just think I\\'d put that info out there for ya :)  I didn\\'t rate the dish because I haven\\'t make it. Made this last night and the entire family love it. The fiesta lime chicken be the ONLY thing that I order while eat at Applebee\\'s and I must say this be right on the mark, maybe even a little good because it lack the burn taste that have be accompany the meal the last couple of time I order it. Will definitely make this again. I make this last night and it turn out awesome. I skip the teriyaki sauce since I didn\\'t have any, but marinate it in tandoori chicken powder instead. I also end up bake the chicken on a bake sheet line with foil and garnish it with cilantro leave and serve with a side of potato skins. Thank you for the recipe. It be so good :) Delicious! Worth all the ingredients. Better than Applebee&#039;s ! Delicious!!!! ...I be a fiesta lime chicken addict when it come to Applebee&#039;s.  I&#039;ll save so much money make at home... and it&#039;s a bazillion time good :D I also broil the chicken with the sauce and cheese on top of the chip already so the cheese and sauce spill and bubble all over the crunchy chips.  YUM! &lt;br/&gt; oh, and for a marinade I do a cheater teriyaki sauce...  I use 1/4 cup orange juice (I actually use the juice of two small clementine I have in the house) , 1/4 cup soya sauce, a sprinkle of ginger powder (optional) and a few slice of fresh garlic (or a sprinkle of garlic powder).  Then I just add the juice of 1 lime, and about a cup (give or take) of water.  Let the chicken breast soak for a few hours.... or a few day :P  And they be moist and flavour-full. Really delicious! This have be the only thing i would eat at Applebees for the past 3 years. I love it so much! Now i might actually try something else since i can make it at home, so easily &amp; just a good! I use chicken tender for small portions, but everything else be exactly a the recipe described. Definitely recommend this to others who love Applebee&#039;s Fiesta Lime Chicken! This be way good than Applebees!! I didt&#039;t have dry ginger so i use fresh which a conversion table suggest 1tbsp. And i didnt have sour cream so i use southwest ranch dressing. I also use  breast and tenderloin and both turn out wonderful. It turn out amaze and my whole family love it! ?????? This be even good than Applebee\\'s. I forget the ginger and it be still delicious. I didn\\'t have cajun season so use season all. I make pico di gallo on the side to eat with it along with rice. It be perfect. I read a comment about &quot;liquid smoke&quot; and why use it if you\\'re cook on the grill. FYI, not much &quot;smoke&quot; flavor if you be use a gas grill. Another comment be about &quot;carcinogens&quot; in liquid smoke... Not use enough that you should be worry about it unless you be totally paranoid!',\n",

I could really pick up the flavor of the thyme, pepper and dry mustard and it be soooooooooo good! I like my toast more on the crispy side, so I cook mine for long than the one minute.

Sorry about that. the flavor in this work great for us. i use cod, up the amount of parsley and add a bite of the juice of the lime too - love the prominent citrus flavor in it due to the zest. i didn\\'t have any cornmeal so have to coat it with cracker crumbs. be happy to elevate this from it 3* rating. this be quite good.  i didn\\'t have any onion so i add some green onion and garlic instead, and lemon juice instead of the lime zest.  i need to add a little more bread crumb to make it stick together but i love the taste of the dijon mustard.  oh, and i add a little hot sauce for some heat a clifford say they be a little bland.  direction be easy to follow and a this be my first time make fish cake i be very impressed.

I didn\\'t follow the recipe exactly use it more a a springboard then add my own seasonings.  It be a nice alternative recipe for fish (that thankfully didn\\'t taste too fishy).

       " \" I make two batch of these for the Thanksgiving dinner we hosted, and they be delicious! I sub instant yeast for the cake yeast, skip sift the flour, and let the KitchenAid knead the dough for me. I do end up add extra flour, but I've be work with yeast dough long enough to expect adjustments. I do think the oven temperature give be a bite high; I have already reduce the temp since I be use a convection oven, but reduce it far after the first roll I bake brown too quickly. I be in a bite of a hurry, so I skip the optional step of butter the rolled-out dough, but do brush the bake roll with melt butter a soon a they come out of the oven, which I always do. (And for easy clean up, I always bake them on parchment paper.) Anyway, I make butterhorn/crescent roll for every Easter and Thanksgiving meal and occasionally change up which recipe I use--everyone enjoy the result of this one :) Thanks for posting, Molly! -November 25, 2007\\nEdited January 27, 2007: Disregard the comment in my original review about the oven temperature be too high. I believe the recipe have be edit since my review be submitted, and the oven temperature give be now lower. Have make this roll every year at Christmas, Easter, some Thanksgivings etc., but my computer crash and I lose all the recipe on my Master Cook.  (we now have a back up device:)  That be said, I think this be the recipe I be give year ago although mine make a double recipe and use I think 6 eggs.  Just to be safe I put 5 in a double batch, don't want them to be too healthy or anything :)\\r\\nThis be the recipe I remember, the dough be a bite sticky due to sugar content but it hold up well to bake and shape into roll if you add flour when roll out a desired.  A light touch of mixing/kneading keep them tender.  I use half of the recipe for cinnamon rolls.  Also have make these use fill such a ham and swiss, taco meat with cheddar, etc but you have to put spar amount of fill like that or it go all over the place.  Another idea be to fill with chop nut and a streusel fill or cream cheese and can cherries, they make a great danish, drizzle with cream cheese frosting.\\r\\nThanks for a great recipe! These be amazing!  And amazingly easy!  I choose to do the butterleaf roll and they come out so perfectly tender and flaky.  I be pretty sure these will be grace our Thanksgiving table this year!

(I make mine small than his suggest size and they be exactly a I remember the one I get from my aunt a a kkid.) 2-Start the recipe with beater on the mixer then switch to dough hook after add the flour. I only have one complaint.  The egg stick to the shell.  Does anyone have any suggestion how to get the shell to peel easily? Haven't try these yet, but plan on it over the next couple days. To have the egg peel easy, put them in a pot with cold water, bring to a boil. After the water begin to boil, turn off and leave in the pan for 12 mintues. Drain water and crack eggs, put in ice cold water to cool for 15 minute and the peel should come off. It be get to be that time of the year to make these delicious Italian &quot;Eggs in a Basket&quot;.  My Italian grandmother make these for me when I be a little girl and now my granddaughter and I make them together about a week before Easter.  \\n\\nStart to gather your ingredient about a week ahead of time.  I have find that food color dye work good than the expensive pellet that you can get in the stores.  Remember that the more vinegar you use the strong the color.  Add a little oil to the mix and you get more of a marble look egg. The process from start to finish take a few hour so plan ahead.  \\n\\nWhen put the basket together don&#039;t forget to save a few strip of dough for the basket handles.  \\n\\nThere be so many way to decorate these.  We use tube frost but what make these so much fun be that you can get very creative by add sprinkles, jelly beans, etc.  \\n\\nThese be a cross between a cookie and cake.  There isn&#039;t any yeast involve so even though it be Passover for our Jewish friend they can enjoy also without break their dietary rules. I&#039;m 61 year old.

If doubling, you may want to do a batch at a time since this require a lot of dry ingredients.  Tastes like I remember though but I&#039;m curious to compare to a family recipe.  Like noted, freely substitute the anise extract if you don&#039;t enjoy.  Leave about a 1/2 cooky worth of dough for the basket &quot;handles&quot;.

I make the rice the day before so it be really quick and easy to put this together at the last minute. At dress be tart and super flavorful - the pinapple add just the right sweet taste and the nut and celery give it a perfect crunch. I leave out the sprout and raisin - we don't like either of them.

I also change this slightly to make it more healthy, luckily it be just one of those dish that you can get away with changing!  I didn't add the salt or the oil and use light soya sauce.  I use freeze rice a I always have leave over rice in my freezer.  Orange juice instead of pineapple juice, corn kernel instead of baby corn and almond instead of peanuts.

I\\'ve try so many different recipe and this be hand down the very best fry chicken yet! who would have think can soup and cornstarch? well it work this recipe be a keeper, you rock and your recipe rock thank you! This be very good! I cook this up for my DH and he love it! What a different way to make chicken batter-using cream of chicken soup! Thanks Kitten, you make me look good tonight! Very good .....will make again....thank you My wife make this last night, but a little different...instead of frying, she bake it in the oven at 375 for 1-1/2 hours. It turn out GREAT!!! The skin be nice & crispy & the meat be moist. THANKS for the idea...will most definately make it, again! This be absolutely amazing!!  Thank you so much for this recipe!  I will make this over and over again!  Kittenkal, I love your recipe so much that many time I just search through your cookbook.  I be guarantee a delicious recipe everytime!  Thank you so much, you make me look AWESOME! My only change be to cut the chicken into strips.\\r\\n(I do add extra cayenne pepper & black pepper.)\\r\\nI also more than double the recipe. That make a lot of strips! LOL\\r\\nGreat taste chicken! Full of flavor! Served the strip with bake fry & slaw\\r\\nThese strip would be great dunk in chicken gravy or alfredo sauce. Heck, it\\'s great alone!\\r\\nMy kid dunk theirs in, bbq sauce, honey mustard & ranch.\\r\\nThe cream of chicken be key in this recipe. \\r\\nI can\\'t wait to share this recipe with my friends!\\r\\nThanks for sharing! :) it easy to make and quite tasty too.  My kid lovvvveee it!! Who need KFC with fry chicken like this!!!!  I make this wonderful chicken a few day ago.  Absolutely the best juicy fry chicken.  I didn\\'t completely fry the chicken on the stove.  I brown the chicken and finish up in the oven on 400F until cook thru, approx 20 minutes.  Delicious Kitt!  Thank you for another winner a usual! This chicken be sooo good!!  Made with tender and they come out perfect!  The bread fell off a little when flip and cook but I think it be because I pu the chicken in the soup mix and then in the fridge for an hour and didn\\'t let it come back to room temp before breading.  Doesn\\'t matter though the chicken be still excellent; moist and tender and not really greasy tasting.  I don\\'t make fry chicken that often (usually baked) but this recipe have change my mind about that! try this tonight and it be very good.  Very crispy.  A bite mild to my taste but I will ramp up the spice next time...I like spicy.  My kid like it my dh like it.  thank for share It be ok, I wouldn\\'t make it again.  I didn\\'t think it have enough flavor for me, and the flour mixture didn\\'t stick that well.  My family say no for this recipe. So very crispy. I think I\\'ll add a litle more cayenne next time and try it with some chicken tenders. And then some wings.... Hate to disagree with chef#1417651 BUT, The wife and I just finish this for Supper and we both agree this be Excellant. Every thing work out just a written. Will definately make this many time in the future. Thanks Kit, keep up the good work.\\r\\n\\r\\nCapn Jack Fabulous!!!  I only have cream of mushroom and I be just hop it would turn out just a good.  It be excellent!!  Thank you!!  2 thumb up from the whole family!! I have have this recipe save for a year and decide to try it! WOW! I be so glad I did.It\\'s easy but messy. I do a you suggest and let it sit before frying. That be the trick!!! Topping stay on instead of come off in the skillet like my usual recipe does. Will make again! Was a hit with DH and my three kids!Made homemade fream of soup and it need a little more salt add to it. This be nice and juicy! I be not the best at fry but I decide to give this recipe a try. I\\'m sure glad I did! I use about 2lbs of boneless skinless chicken breasts, which be 3 humongous ones.  I cut them in half to make 6 piece and make a directed.  I don\\'t usually have full fat cream of chicken soup on hand, but I do today, and I think it be probably important to use this in this recipe over the low fat, which be thinner.  I deep fry my piece for about 15 minute each and they come out delicious.  Next time I\\'ll add a bite more season to my flour mixture, but this be a very good and straightforward recipe that I\\'ll use again. I may also try Ackman\\'s suggestion of bake next time a well.  Thanks Kittencal for a good, yummy recipe!  Made for the I Recommend Tag. Delicious! I cut my chicken breast into tenders, and they taste just like one from a restaurant, they be so good! I must admit I use about 3 pinch of cayenne (we like it spicy). We fry these in our deep fryer at 375 degree for 4 minutes. They be perfect! Thank you for posting, I will definitely make these again! I really do not get to eat it due to me be on a diet but my husband love it. I do fry up some of the dough and eat little piece of it and it be very good. Will make again and again. Thank you for the awesome recipe! First, I want to clarify that I do not rate recipe 5 star just to be nice or polite but only when it\\'s spectacular. This be SPECTACULAR!  The chicken be unbelievably tender and season perfectly. I make chicken strip cut from breasts. Followed the recipe exactly except I reduce the garlic powder the 1/2 tsp (personal taste preference).  Don\\'t miss let the chicken sit for a while after breading. I have NO problem with the bread fall off but I think that be due to let it sit like instructed.  I marinate the cut chicken in the liquid mixture for a couple of hour in the fridge before bread and frying.  That also might have make a difference with the bread stay on.  Some have mention taste be bland.  I disagree a we think the taste be perfect.  Follow the direction exactly but remember everyone have their own preference with taste.  When they be do if you think it need more sprinkle some season over the finish product and adjust the recipe. Excellent!  I even forget the egg and this recipe be phenomenal.  I do strip also and they be the best I\\'ve ever had.  Tender and delicious.  As always, thank Kittencal for another out of this world recipe. Yum, yum, yummy this be good chicken.  I put the chicken piece in the soup mixture for the afternoon and then flour them and let them sit for an hour.  They fry up so wonderfully.  They be juicy and moist with a crispy crunchy coat on the outside.  I will use this recipe again, we  love it.  Thank you Kittencal for another winner of a recipe. My family love it! This be now in my permanent cookbook. I really like the bread on this. It be the best ever. For the first time, my son eat the bread but leave the chicken. It\\'s usually the other way around. What I didn\\'t like be that the chicken be rather bland. Another winner!  I use 5 boneless skinless chicken thigh (so I leave off the last 2 T of flour and cornstarch), and follow the recipe with the exception of substitutuing the season salt, which I be out of, with a cumin blend mixture I always keeep on hand (chili powder, cumin, a little cayenne, granulate garlic and onion, a salt-parsley blend, etc).  It take 8 minute in about 2 inch of oil on medium heat to reach 185 degree on the instant thermometer.  I use a 99% fat-free condense chicken soup and let the chicken sit on a rack after dredging, for an hour or so at room temperature.  The coat adhere nicely, crisp up beautifully and the chicken be nice and moist inside.  The skinless thigh work perfectlly, I see no need to use a thigh with the skin on for this recipe (usually I find it help keep the chicken moist, but it\\'s not need here!).  I often oven fry chicken, and I think I may try that with this recipe a some reviewer did, just to make it a little healthier.  This be a keeper recipe for sure!   Update:  I do this recipe again with 4 very large bone-in thighs, follow the season exactly but sub cream of mushroom soup for the cream of chicken.  I brown in the oil over med-high heat for 8-10 minutes, then remove to pan with a rack and bake at 350 for 45 minutes, to an internal temperature of 180, and it be also excellent prepare this way with the big bone-in thighs.  (I\\'d check the internal temp at 30 minute and it be barely 160 degrees.) One of the first recipe I would consider, use can anything. This be truly creative. I usually don&#039;t make fry chicken because I don&#039;t know how. But I follow your recipe and it come out really well. Everyone enjoy it. Made this chicken for the kid and family, and EVERYONE luv&#039;d, luv&#039;d LUV&#039;D it!  Juicy and tasty with every crispy bite.  I add a small scoop of chili powder and it kick up the heat and the flavor perfectly.  Definitely a keeper! My husband love this and I do too. Love fry chicken but can not eat it often so when I do want it to be crispy outside and juicy inside. And that be exactly what I get with this recipe. Was wonder if instead of fry ,..... bake in oven ??',\n",

This be a hit with my old son and DH and the young one like it too but wasn't keen on the  onion flecks. I'll chop them more finely next time and maybe even saute them first. I didn't make the glaze on top and bake it for an hour. Super easy to make. Went well with mash potatoes. Thanks for posting! I have use Yoshida's gourmet sauce for years.. and it be great on just about every thing. the Meatloaf be always a big hit.. I want something to put in the freezer for this spring when DH come in late form the field.  This be easy to mix up.  I bake it, cool it, cut it into slice and wrap it to place in the freezer for later.  But of course I have to have a piece first.  :-)   Yum, it be very good.  HouseDragon be kind enough to send me a bottle of the Yoshida sauce 2 spring ago.  I have just enough to make her burger recipe tomorrow night.     I adopt this Chef for the *Spring PAC 2008* game Excellent and so easy to make.  The flavor be just perfect.  I choose not to use the sauce on top and I think I probably won't do that in the future because this be perfect without it.  Thanks so much for sharing.  Made for PAC Fall 09 :) Excellent.  I follow the recipe to the letter for the ingredient and portion but then I form four small loaf and then wrap each with two tissue paper thin slice of prosciutto.  From there I get back on recipe and bake for 35 minutes, then basted, put back in for 10 more minutes.  Then remove from oven to rest.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;WOW!  It be fantastic!\",\n",

Rarely have I ever say this about a recipe, bite this dip have no flavor and be heavy and leave a funny feel and taste.  I follow the direction exactly.  After taste it, I try to give it a little life by add more horseradish, garlic salt and pepper, but it be still tasteless and yucky. My guest for Christmas Eve leave it on their plat uneaten.',\n",
       " ' This be Delish!!  I make a few change to it, base on what I have and what we like.  I use Turkey instead of beef, I do not use the potato or carrots. I actually use Traditional Pasta Sauce instead of Tomato Sauce.  Black bean instead of white, and plain lowfat yogurt instead of Sour Cream.  I do a little healthy spin on it.   I also add some re-fried bean to give it that extra taco spin and it thicken up nicely.  This be a Wonderful soup, I share the recipe with girl from work.

       " \" Oh, Susie, you have a true five-star recipe with this one! Combining my husbnd's love of pecan and mine of anything cook with buttermilk, this will get make often in our home. I didn't change a thing and do like the fact that it use ingredient I always have on hand....pecans in the freezer and buttermilk in the refrigerator. Good for you! Very yummy.  Troy make the first one with regular cream instead of buttermilk -- guess the think all thing that come in quart container be buttermilk, oops.  We have enough crust and pecan to make another accord to recipe, though.  Funny thing be that a fair number of folk prefer the mistake!  I would love to try this again with a few candy pecan halve on top or more chunky style, miss the chunk a bit. I add just a few more pecans, 'cuz my husband love them, but otherwise I didn't change a thing.  This be a delightful change from the usual heavy pecan pie.  It will definitely be a repeat at our house.  Thanks for a really good one, Susie. OMG Susie,this be a piece of heaven... Dh and DS be just drool after every bite of this simply awesome pie!  This taste almost similar to a butter tart texture. I didn't have any pecan on hand so I sub with walnuts, it be THAT delicious with walnuts, I can just imagine how it would be with pecans, I can't wait to make this again! thank you so much for share such a wonderful recipe....Kittencal:) This recipe I make for Thanksgiving and it be wonderful.  We love pecan pie, but it be always so sweet and we love buttermilk pie a well.  I can honestly say we will never serve a buttermilk or pecan pie ever again, we be stick with this recipe.  This recipe be so easy even for someone who be not experience in baking. Hubby literally have to pry the pie plate away from my daughter and me and we both have little girl fit when he did. This be one of the best pie I have had. I didn't use the crust and didn't miss it and I do use egg beater for the eggs. Also I throw the pecan in the blender because they don't like whole nut for some reason but will eat them when they be finely chopped. Weirdo's. The pie separate like a regular pecan pie except you have a dreamy custard bottom layer with the traditional crunchy pecan top layer. It's the best of two world and I will be make this again and again. Thanks so much! Susie what be that air temperature when you create the buttermilk pie-the heaven be on your side. I become an overnite star among big belly baker at church (NOT MINE). they love your recipe. thank you for success. it do feel good to have a big sister to show you how to make alot of people happy. thank toni for livingston,tx. I be sorry, we have to throw this pie away. It have a weird grey color, and my husband say that it smell rancid. This be 1 of 3 recipe from this site for pecan pie that I try for Thanksgiving, I be so glad that when we have company, this one do not get cut into!!! Such a shame to waste all those lovely ingredients, but it do not work for us. This be one of those pie that you can't imagine anyone not liking... My whole family go back for a second piece and woofed down 2 pie in one sitting!  You can be assure I will be make these again and save this recipe in a very safe place! A healthy pecan pie at last, without the syrupy sweetness. The only way this could turn out bad would be maybe the buttermilk be out of date. It be good to give the buttermilk a good shake before you pour it. Thank you so much for this recipe Susie\",\n",

I never know how good homemade hot cocoa could be. Thanks for such a warm and tasty recipe. Like another reviewer, I make mine with vanilla flavor soy milk, so I omit the vanilla. Loved the addition of the vanilla in this!  Made to have with my breakfast this morning Recipe #94532.  Went great!  Can't wait to try this with peanut butter and toast.  I love to dip my toast in my cocoa.  Yummmmmm!  Thanks for share DiScharf I can buy cocoa here in Costa Rica by the Kilo. It grow and be make here. Its about the only type of chocolate I can get.

Drinking this right now, it be very good.  I do the rich variation with the extra cocoa.  A good rule of thumb with any milk base drink be to make it with whatever you be use to drinking/using for the best taste to you.  I use 2%.  I do end up heat it a little long after it be all mix up, just because I like my hot chocolate REALLY hot, just about 30 extra seconds.  If you be serve to  company add some whip cream on top, and sprinkle with a little extra cocoa for that extra little bite of presentation.  Good recipe! Excellent! I use 3 tsp cocoa, add a tsp of powder milk and reduce the Splenda to 1 tbsp. Thank you for sharing. Made for Comfort Cafe- Snow Queen Round 01/10. Mmm Mmm Good. Great bedtime drink.

I would suggest make the cooky small than state in the recipe, 1/4 cup make huge cookies!  I make them this big and it take 2 1/2 hour at 225 degree F. in the oven to dry them completely.  Next time I make this recipe I will make them half the size.  Family love them and I'll definitely make these again!\",\n",
       " ' My husband be a fan of regular white potato so he be skeptical about me make these a a side dish. He love them, and ask me to make them again! Be careful to slice the potato a close to evenly a you can or you\\'ll end up with some do and others not cook through. This recipe be great! You have my vote!  These potato be excellent.  Very easy to throw together, bake, and enjoy.  Followed your direction and I couldn\\'t ask for a nice side.\\r\\nThanks for share a nifty recipe.\\r\\nLaudee C. I allow these delicious, very thinly slice potato to brown to a light, crispy crunch on top. I add salt and freshly grind pepper and they be fabulous!  Thanks for a wonderful potato side, Angela! I really love the convenience of this easy potato dish.  The flavor of the olive oil, season and parmesan be just right.  Next time I\\'ll add a little more olive oil, broth, or butter during cooking,as the potato be a little dry for our taste. These be very tasty.  I like them cook exactly per the recipe, but next time I be go to put the cheese on halfway through cook instead of at the begin so that it doesn\\'t get quite so crisp.   4 star for easy & delicious!  quick, easy, and very tasty!  I cub the tater instead of slice (quicker for me) and bake them in my toaster oven.  Everybody love the slightly chrunchy outside and tender inside. Very nice recipe. Thanks I follow the recipe exactly a it be written, but with all the good review it\\'s gotten, I think I must have do something wrong. Maybe it\\'s just a matter of taste, but I find this dish to be very bland and, a another reviewer noted, a bite dry. I consider just toss it out, but I hate to waste things, so I sprinkle it liberally with garlic powder and add some salt and pepper and a pinch or two each of cayenne pepper and paprika. I also add a tiny bite more olive oil to moisten it up a bit. This liven it up enough for u to go ahead and have it for dinner, but I won\\'t be make this recipe again. Shame on me! I must have make these 2 dozen time since last Fall and never review them. They\\'re fabulous! I usually make them a a side for our Sunday dinner.(if I\\'m roast something)Really easy and really tasty.\\r\\n these be awesome!!  my husband and child love them & ask me to make them twice within one week.  very delicious, very easy to prepare and bake.  These be absolutly wonderful!\\r\\nSo simple and easy I can\\'t believe how great they taste! It be VERY VERY good. The only thing we do wrong be my boyfriend put on TOO much parmesan and say that he didn\\'t like that part. Definitely would make again. I\\'ve make these probably 10 time since I first get the recipe, so I figure I should leave a comment!  This recipe make perfect potato every time. I\\'ve use both red and gold small potato and try different seasonings, and they\\'re always a hit.  Thanks!! These be pretty good. I make them to go with my St Pat\\'s dinner. I also add garlic and onion powder. From other reviewer tips,I put my cheese on half way through cook and I use my Salad Shooter so that the potato would be slice the same size. Thanks for posting! This be very good, I didn\\'t have any italian season so I use Ranch season and they be very tasty, I also throw in some slice of onion.\\r\\n\\r\\nYUMMY I make a mistake make these delicious potato - I slice them too thin (under 1/4\") so they over bake -  They be quite dark but very crisp & tasty.  I put the parmesan on them for the last 25 minute of baking. The picture I take do not do them justice so I be not post it to the recipe.  Thanks for a very good recipe AngelaTN\\n\\n2 Dec 07  Made these again this time I slice them just over 1/4\" add parmesan 15 minute before serve and they be perfect - Wonderful brown crisp & tasty Really tasty ! I serve these for Brunch in addition to Recipe #112151 Thanks for new keeper! This be a very easy, flavorful way to serve potatoes. I use small Yukon gold potato and do a others suggest - put the cheese on at the last 15 minutes.\\r\\nI would love to try these with dill season also, but like the Italian season very much. Thanks, Carole in Orlando I\\'m just here to echo the other great reviews.  Super easy, yummy and I don\\'t think I\\'d do anything differently.  The cheese be good a it be crispy. So easy to prepare and delicious!  I make a small batch on a Pampered Chef stone mini-pan and they be wonderful.  I have make this twice in the past few weeks. Excellent potatoes! So easy to prepare and so delicious. These be easy and make a good side dish for italian sausage. I use small yukon gold potato and add an extra 1/2 teaspoon of italian seasoning. This be a really tasty and easy way to make potatoes. We mix the cheese in through all potato instead of just on top. It come out really good. Will definately make again.',\n",
       " ' This be a quick and easy recipe.  It\\'s also the first time I have make bread pudding in the microwave.  It be very tasty.  Thanks so much, and welcome to the Zaar!!! This be the most wonderful bread pudding.  Simple ingredients, easy and quick to put together and nine minute to cook, what more could someone ask for to create such a great dish. This go into my recipe Hall of Fame and will be make often.  The only thing I add to the recipe be a little cinnamin.   Great recipe. Very easy to follow. My microwave take a bite longer, almost double the time list in the recipe. However, it set well, be tasty... even good than I expected. Made this for my husband who run out of the raisin bread he love to have with his breakfast.  We like it very much.  First time I have make bread pudding in the microwave, and it be very easy.  Definitely will keep this one to use again. This be a good bread pudding, though not the best I\\'ve had. However, I feel it be necessary to factor in the convenience of be able to make the pudding use only two dish (the glass pan and the measure cup) in only twelve minutes. It be a little soggy, even after cook for the full twelve minute in my high-powered microwave, in which regular cook time usually have to be shortened. Other than that, though, I don\\'t have any complaints. I think that I will add cinnammon next time for extra flavor. Thanks for sharing! Not bad at all for a quick, easy pudding!  Tastes great, add cinnamon, not nutmeg and it be good and tasty.  A wee bite \"liquidy\" when come out of the microwave, but upon standing, like the recipe states, it do firm up.  Nice recipe. Good for a quick pudding.  I cut back on the sugar but spread jam onto the bread for something different.  Needs to sit for a while to firm up but a really quick fast dessert.  Thanks! Made this with French bread and Craisins.  It be so easy and so totally yummy.  My family have request it so often that I have probably make it 5 time in the last few weeks! Thank You so much! This recipe be a life saver lol. I have be die to make bread pudding, but since my oven be not function haven\\'t be able to.',\n",
       " ' We make these all the time.  Fast and easy snack, and my kid do love helping. This work out beautifully!  I cut the dough stick in half but let my kid (6 & 4) do the rest and they have a blast!  We didn\\'t actually make them look like pretzels, but we make all sort of other things.  Lots of letter (e\\'s o\\'s and p\\'s mainly, with 1 g for the first letter of our kindergarten teacher\\'s last name!) and some numbers.  This would be a great at home activity for learn letter and number a well a spell basic words.  I make some that look like wreath and it start me think about how this could be make for different holiday for class party etc.  I know a lot of teacher around here want healthy snack instead of cooky and cupcake with lot of icing.  A trye kid friendly winner Karen.  Thanks! These be great fun!  Made them for the superbowl.  Had to practice the whole twist thing for a while, but after a few try they actually start to look like pretzels.  I sprinkle them lightly with some sea salt and serve them with Faith\\'s Beer Cheese Dip.  The dip have a salty flavor to it and compliment the \"pretzels\" well. Excellent! This be the easy fast way to make wonderful pretzels!! Thanks for a keeper!!!!! RE I try this for our son who be crazy for pretzel and what a find, He go \"mom, these be good\" :) For a fast easy recipe that taste great I would recommend this to everyone. Thanks for a keeper. Get well, GodBlessYou..\\r\\n:) I be skeptical a I make these, but  they come out good. They be more flaky than chewy for a pretzel. Also, they be quite small than your run of the mill soft pretzel. Despite that, darn these be tasty!! What a FANTASTIC idea!  I make these for my son\\'s baseball 3rd birthday party and these be a complete hit!  I be make quite the spread and didn\\'t have time to make pretzel from scratch and this recipe be a godsend....and make it that much more special b/c they be from Amy.  I will be make these again soon..so yummy!  Served with recipe#280453 which really take them to the next level.  tx! Amy, I wish you be here to eat these! I will think of you every time I make them. They be fantastic. I try them three different way (with grind sea salt, big sea salt, and garlic salt), and the big sea salt be the big hit. After make 8 out of the 12 pretzels, I finally figure out a trick--roll the dough out until it\\'s about 12 inch long, and then flip it around a if it be a jump rope veeeeery gently until it be about 22 inch long. If the dough be this long, you will get perfect pretzels!',\n",

I be so very excite to try it a I enjoy try differant breads, specially the rustic types.  Not sure what I do wrong, but know it be something early on - think that it could be that it would be OK I precede to complete and what mistake - a you can tell by my photo I only get ONE Boule and it be heavy and dense on the inside, though the crust be nice.

For fear of burn the chocolate (and also because I don\\'t get to use it much), I pull out my double boiler and use it to melt the butter and chocolate; it do it\\'s usual fantastic job.  I be press for time, so I put the dough in the freezer for 30 minutes, which do the trick!  I use my cookie scoop (or should I say DH did), which I think be tbsp size, and then roll the scoop into perfect balls.

I make this with brisket for the &quot;something sweet&quot; for Rosh Hashanah. My husband who be Jewish say it felt traditional. It&#039;s pretty easy to make, and for me the mint taste be perfect.

Great for a quick and easy meal. We think this casserole be great.  I didn't have enchilada sauce, so I use a 10 oz. can of Rotel, an 8 oz. can of tomato sauce and 2 T. ketchup, with about a teaspoon of cumin.  I also add about half a small can of chop black olive to the hamburger mixture.  I layer cheddar cheese in the casserole.  For the corn tortillas, I find that 8 of them cut into strip work well.

With the roast red pepper and spinach it be a very tasty combination of flavours. The crispy crunch of the Phyllo be perfect.  I hate to admit it but I forget to add the salt and pepper to the oil so sprinkle sea salt and freshly grind pepper on top of the packages; turn out wonderful. A lovely entree to serve anytime to guests, thank for posting, I will be make this again!! We just eat this for dinner.  Good recipe idea.  However, it need some seasoning.   Be sure to add your favorite season to the chicken/pepper/cheese combination before wrap it up in phyllo dough.',\n",

       " \" Easy and Yummy. I double the flour and  spices. After coat the chicken I brown in oil on top of the stove. I add the leave over flour and spice to the broth.  I also add a can of Rotel tomato with chili's.I cook in a ceramic casserole dish with a lid at 450 for same amount of time. Chicken be so tender it fell off the  bone. Oh MY GOODNESS!!  This be such a good combo of flavors!  I bake this in a glass casserole, and make a few substitutions: use thigh filet from Sam's, double the flour, throw the flour mixture in a ziplock and shake it, throw it in a hot pan and sear it a little.  No real veggies, just onion powder, garlic powder and celery salt (guessed on the amount - maybe 1/3 t. each).  Used chicken bullion w/ hot water, and mix in the sour cream and pour it over the chicken after put it in the casserole dish.  Baked at 370 for 45 minute and then put the cheese on top, let it sit cover for 10 minute or so.  This be SO GOOD and EASY!!  Certainly a KEEPER...hubby give it a 10!\",\n",

So I didn't deduct any however I make the recipe with only spray the polenta pan with no oil and only give just a light spray cook the onion the resuslt be an absolutely delicious non oil dinner. Don't get me wrong I love deep fry/cooking with oil but be try to stay away from it. The sauce on the chicken be fantastic. I find the polenta in a specialty Italian store and love it - up until your recipe I do not like polenta. This be a winner of a recipe -Good luck in RSC13 5 star Cooking time and prep time be totally wrong. My DH love this recipe however, both my DD and I felt it have way too much cinnamon for our tastes. The recipe be very creative in the use of the the special ingredients. This be delicious and it seem so fancy! I do decrease the cinnamon a bite because I be afraid it would be over-powering. This be delicious, and I will make it again. Thank you for posting! This be a wonderfully easy and different dinner.  I love the caramelize onion in the sauce and the flavor that it impart to the chicken.  Even fry in oil, my package polenta do not get a really nice crisp on it, but the whole dish be still lovely! I hope you'll forgive me, I make the chicken to go over couscous,  it's an excellent recipe which we loved, and my young daughter say KEEP this recipe mum!  and come from her, that be HIGH praise indeed!    Easy to marinate the chicken while do the other prep, a you say, it all come together very efficiently.  Iif anything I be a trifle generous with the cinnamon a I only have a little bite left, ironically,  this be what my daughter like best!   I do slice about 100 gr mushroom and toss them in towards the end of the chicken cook time, mostly because I have them and everyone like them (except me), this be also well-received.  Garnished with spring onions,   this be a very good meal, definitely on the rotation!  (And I will have a go at the polenta next time!)   Made for Alphabet tag game. I love fusion recipe like these!  The dish be great- I especially love the sauce which be well-flavored and unique.  It remind me of curry, mole sauce, and Asian sauce all at the same time.  The fry polenta be a nice change of pace from the usual brown rice or quinoa that I would normally use.\",\n",

Awesome!  And easy!  Was gobble up by my boyfriend's kids, and they be the picky eaters!  I couldn't find black walnut flavor so I use Hazelnut...I'm assume any nutty flavor would work.  Thanks! I love the slight crunch the cornmeal adds.  Mine didn't really come out with a pudding part...it be more like a sweet cornbread on top of sweeten cranberries.  The cream didn't seem to separate out to form a pudding layer.  Nevertheless it be delicious and I'm glad I make it!\",\n",

My kitty kat Couldn't and wouldn't leave me or my wife alone until they have their share. Great taste Chops!  Delicious!  My hubby make his own Italian sausage, so I'm always look for different recipe to use the sausage.  I use thick butterfly-cut pork, stuff them and fold them in half.  I follow the direction exactly, but I do cover the skillet with a lid while cook and it take about an hour.  Wouldn't change a thing!  Thanks Aroostook! I make this last night and serve it over italian rice and it be great.  My company and my bf love it too.  I definitely will be make this again!! this be a great recipe. two meat be good than one. Delicious and Flavorful!  Thanks for a great recipe! I think this recipe be good.  Different.  I didn't use the red peppers, but I feel some roast bell may have kick this up a bit.  I may play with the recipe again, it's much good than stuff chop with breading. We make this for our family Christmas get together.

Crunchy, crisp shrimp and buttery soft buns, I run out of food.  Great recipe, will be go on my lineup! I make some change in that I make my own shrimp and homemade tartar sauce and remoulade sauce.  On one sandwich we use tartar, and remoulade on the other.  My son prefer the tartar sauce, and I prefer the remoulade.  I can never not enjoy freshly cook shrimp!
